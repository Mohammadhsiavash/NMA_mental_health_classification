Without going into too much detail, I've had feelings for him for a while and he knew. We still remain best friends because we honestly believe we are soulmates, whether we're together or not. I found out about what he did 3 weeks ago and have been working through it ever since.\\n\\nThen something happened today with someone else and I spent the entire day going from happy, numb to sad. It was a mess and I told my friend about it, and he started feeling extremely guilty for what he did, even though I wasn't trying to blame him or anything (these were two separate problems, but similar enough to basically be tied into each other). He's just not great at giving me the answers I need or expect, and everything just seems to confuse or overwhelm him to the point where he doesn't know what to say anymore, and he started hating himself over it (I've always been the communicative one, and have done my best to understand and never hold it against him, but I was also kind of fed up and said that I've just been expecting answers to finally come).\\n\\nI was starting to have a breakdown myself and on the verge of tears. But them seeing him in the same state just shifted my mood completely. I was no longer sad. I was worried something might happen, but it was like I forgot about my problems and was entirely focused on him, doing everything to make sure he was okay (given his history with mental health, I was terrified of a relapse so I just stopped thinking about myself). This tends to happen to me in crisis moments. I will completely forget about my own worries or fears and will be entirely dedicated to fixing the problem or getting others through it.\\n\\nI have managed to calm him down, and honestly since I haven't felt sad myself. I don't know if it's adrenaline or something, but I was curious to know if anyone else experiences this in very tense situations where you believe you have to help or fix an issue?\\n\\nEdit: Other instances would include handling physical confrontations my friends might get involved in (even though fighting makes me inherintly anxious and I avoid it as much as possible) , or me being drunk out of my mind and a friend was in such a worse state, I just kind of forgot that I was drunk and made sure to take care of him like I was an EMT, because no one else would or could\\n\\nAnother edit: I guess I did eventually hit that crash and started fidgeting and frantically tapping my desk. I really had to hold back tears because I was in party chat with friends. I also couldn't read anything properly. I went to lay down a bit and I think I feel better now\",\n",

              " {'sequence': '  \\nHello, I’m writing this because I need to vent, I’m tired and not sure what more I can do. I’ve been married to my wife for 8 years. We have a 4 year old son. My wife’s OCD started manifesting after my motorcycle accident 2 months after my son was born. I was stuck at home for 3 months with casts on both my arms. During that time my wife started to focus more on cleanliness and started calling things “contaminated”, washing her hands more often and longer than usual. At first I didn’t give it too much thought, but then she started getting more and more anxious until finally she had a serious panic attack over some bird poop on our balcony.   \\nAt that time I started doing some research online, found a psychiatrist and convinced her to go together for a visit. At first reluctant but eventually she agreed. By that stage the skin on her hands and forearms was already quite damaged from all the washing so when we walked in the doctor immediately spotted the issue. The psychiatrist wanted to start her on some medication, don’t remember what that was, but she didn’t want to take it - she was fearing it would affect her health negatively.  \\nAfter some time had passed and another anxiety attack happened I started looking into non-pharmacological ways of dealing with OCD. That is when I found out about CBT and found a specialist in my city. My wife agreed to start therapy and at first everything looked great. I tried to read up on the details to support her as much as possible with exposures. Suddenly bird poop was no longer an issue, there was an observable improvement in hand skin condition.   \\nWe bought a house and started planning our move to the suburbs but then things took a turn for the worse. Talks about contamination became more frequent. She started setting up rules and procedures for coming back home, washing and became aggressive if me or our son did not follow them. After talking to her therapist I was told to not give in and behave normally, which I did. I told her not to throw away stuff she considered contaminated, but that way she started putting “traps” around the house - contaminated items she was putting aside to clean at a later date. If anyone touched these there would be a huge quarrel.  \\nWe live in a city that has a fair amount of pigeons everywhere. One day she found a dead pigeon on the road and had a breakdown, after that she started being afraid of anything laying on the road, planning her routes everyday and sending me maps with crossed dead pigeon sightings.  \\nWe\\'ve known each other for 15 years and lived together for 12. We partied at university so having a couple of drinks on a Saturday was normal. But recently it has become more and more alcohol abuse. Saturdays turned into Sundays which later turned into a whole week of alcohol in the evening because of some anxiety attack.  \\nThe therapist has tried to keep that in check but I feel that nowadays she is not telling the truth or she is just putting on a mask during her sessions. My wife brought me in for one of the sessions after we had a fight about some item around the house being contaminated. She thought that the therapist would agree with her and convince me that her compulsions were warranted.   \\nAt this stage we don’t sleep together. If I wanted to touch her or hug her I’d need to take a shower every time beforehand. I love her with all my heart and I know it\\'s the OCD talking when she has an attack but there is less and less time when she is just herself.  \\nI will never be able to fully understand how she feels or what she is going through no matter how hard I try to put myself in her shoes.  \\nMy life has become a constant stress maze thinking continuously about every step and action around the house. Worrying whether I\\'m not putting some item in a wrong \"contaminated\" place.  \\nI can clearly see this is affecting our son as well and I’m worried about his emotional development.  \\nWhich brings me to the recent attack. We left our son with grandparent for one week so we could figure out a couple things around the new house. It\\'s a gated community of semi detached houses with each containing its own trash area. We are still waiting on the furniture so we don\\'t live there and the community is still technically a construction site. Because of that some construction workers must have dumped some trash bags in our area. I was cleaning up the area, noticed that and told her we need to clean it up. After I did that she started freaking out about me contaminating the car, new house and the old house. In the heat of the moment she grabbed a knife and started threatening that she\\'d hurt herself if I don\\'t follow her procedure saying she is too tired and doesn\\'t have the strength to continue. I was speechless, total loss of words. Afterwards she was playing it down, saying she just wanted to scare me into doing what she wants.   \\nI\\'m really not sure what to do anymore. I\\'m keeping an eye on her but I\\'m afraid she would be capable of doing something to herself at this stage.',\n",

My father is an attorney so I’ve always learned to have evidence to back up anything I say, with emotional abuse, it’s very difficult to find evidence outside of a few text messages or emails.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n I had tried explaining what was going on to one therapist I had while I was still unsure of what I was going through and she told me his actions weren’t abusive. So, I stayed. This is why I always recommend you interview multiple therapists before just picking one to listen to. Had I stayed with that therapist longer, who knows where I would be. After I left the relationship, the lack of evidence drove me insane. I was always in so much psychological pain. I couldn’t interact with others without tears forming from his voice in my head or having memories pop into my head. I always looked depressed and was never invited to anything as I wasn’t “fun” enough. I became very aggressive during this time. I was kicked out of a bar and the bouncer called me a bitch/cunt and I went off. Next thing I know I woke up in the hospital with two black eyes. They weren’t from the bouncer, I had drunkenly stumbled and fell flat on my face. I was so shocked to see how awful I looked, but was at the same time relieved because I was finally able to see pain. Please note that I do NOT recommend accidental or voluntary self harm as according to one of my other therapists, that is common for emotional abuse survivors. Instead we need to break our silence and educate and have people start looking deeper than the skin level and understand that the scars that lie beneath can truly be the deepest. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n This was a post from Instagram \\\\*\\\\*he\\\\_never\\\\_hit\\\\_me\\\\_but\\\\*\\\\* and really spoke to me and helped me understand my need for self harm and how it isn’t the answer.',\n",

I found out about what he did 3 weeks ago and have been working through it ever since.\\n\\nThen something happened today with someone else and I spent the entire day going from happy, numb to sad. It was a mess and I told my friend about it, and he started feeling extremely guilty for what he did, even though I wasn't trying to blame him or anything (these were two separate problems, but similar enough to basically be tied into each other). He's just not great at giving me the answers I need or expect, and everything just seems to confuse or overwhelm him to the point where he doesn't know what to say anymore, and he started hating himself over it (I've always been the communicative one, and have done my best to understand and never hold it against him, but I was also kind of fed up and said that I've just been expecting answers to finally come).\\n\\nI was starting to have a breakdown myself and on the verge of tears. But them seeing him in the same state just shifted my mood completely. I was no longer sad. I was worried something might happen, but it was like I forgot about my problems and was entirely focused on him, doing everything to make sure he was okay (given his history with mental health, I was terrified of a relapse so I just stopped thinking about myself). This tends to happen to me in crisis moments. I will completely forget about my own worries or fears and will be entirely dedicated to fixing the problem or getting others through it.\\n\\nI have managed to calm him down, and honestly since I haven't felt sad myself.

Despite growing up being treated like an outcast because I stood out among my peers during a time where autism wasn\\'t as discussed or understood as it is today, it seems the tables have flipped. I\\'m a fairly well-functioning adult on the spectrum in my late 20s, university graduate, etc, and it\\'s mostly neuros I\\'ve met who don\\'t understand obvious jokes, have no respect for other peoples\\' boundaries, ask inappropriate questions, need babysitting, and blow up over the most petty of slights.\\n\\nJust this past summer, I was harassed by a coworker 6 years younger than me who really went out of his way to make my work days miserable. Granted, he was a douche in general, but he probably got off on telling me that he was gonna snitch on me for pulling out my phone during work, pointing out everything I ever did wrong (even at times when I didn\\'t), making thinly-veiled threats, and on his last day, he said something along the lines of \"I\\'ve always hated working with you, you\\'re an idiot, you\\'re a piece of shit for yelling at ———— for not doing your job, and you need to adjust to your job, it doesn\\'t need to adjust for you.\" For the record, I never yelled at the person in question. I got a bit frustrated with him once because he was bringing in carts faster than I could keep up with when I had to wipe them down.\\n\\nThe same summer — and I\\'m not encouraging anything here, just saying what I did, something I rarely partake in — my roommate\\'s friends would come over once in a while, including a girl who I really grew to like. We\\'d all hang out, drink, play card games. Their second time there (that I saw them, anyway), we were all a little stoned, heading back from the gas station and that same girl went off with my roommate, leaving just me and her sister. We eventually found her, and found out she\\'d gone to a total strangers\\' bonfire and asked them if they had any shrooms. They called the cops, and we stayed up for much of the night, waiting for the patrol car to leave the street. A few visits later, she had the audacity to tell me that I was like a child because I was trying to take a pizza out of the oven with my bare hands (yeah, I don\\'t know why I was doing that either). That was the last any of them ever came over. Like, okay, I\\'m the one who needs babysitting when you can\\'t even control your damn impulses when you\\'re baked. Got it.\\n\\nBesides that, it just seems like in general neuros are the worst when it comes to not understanding when I\\'m making an obvious joke. My sense of humor isn\\'t very sophisticated. It\\'s not my fault someone thinks \"shitposting\" (for context, I was promoting my shitposting group about a band I love) means to maliciously mock something instead of showing affectionate humor or thinks that a popular copypasta I shared is me stealing valor.

These are all just the most recent examples. Others include bosses who don\\'t have the balls to tell me I\\'m fired to my face and just send me home early and fire me the next morning, supervisors who accuse me of lying, coworkers who act like my passive-aggressive junior high bullies, professors who refuse to accept my apology if I\\'m unintentionally disruptive, or send long, raving emails to me because I didn\\'t acknowledge them by their proper titles (i.e. \"dr.\"), etc.\\n\\nReally, it\\'s just frustrating. Early in my life, I was led to believe that I was the weird one. That I had something wrong with me. And perhaps I did. But now, if anything, it\\'s the other way around, and I hate it. It doesn\\'t make me feel like I\\'m better than them, it just makes me feel so much more isolated. Hateful, even. I know that neuros aren\\'t an entirely bad lot, because there\\'s plenty I get along with and can even pass as one myself for a period of time, I\\'m just rapidly losing my patience with them in general.',\n",

              " {'sequence': '**Posting this review because there isn\\'t much feedback on this drug online! I tried looking for it myself before starting Adzenys and did not find much.**\\n\\nI\\'ve been medicated for ADHD for 8 years. Over the years I\\'ve been on Vyvanse, Adderall (instant & XR), Ritalin, & Evekeo. \\n\\nMy psychiatrist recently wanted me to try Adzenys. I\\'m always game to try a new drug for my ADHD, especially when my doctor boasted about the fact that his other patients on it were claiming it lasted 10+ hours with no crash. \\n\\nIf you\\'re not familiar with Adzenys, it\\'s the bioequivalent of Adderall XR, but without the salts. It\\'s a dissolvable tablet. I had a feeling I wasn\\'t going to like it because Adderall XR made me extra moody and the crash was brutal.  \\n\\nBefore starting, I was on 50mg Vyvanse and 20mg Adderall. The Vyvanse only lasts about 5-6 hours for me, so I take the Adderall in the afternoon. I\\'m on the highest does of Adzeys btw (18.8mg).\\n\\nTo start with, the design of the drug is counterintuitive when dealing with ADHD folks. It\\'s a very fragile pill since it\\'s dissolvable, so it comes in a large box with blister packs. Within this box, it comes with a slim plastic case that holds 6 pills/blister packs to take on the go. I always have my pills with me because my mornings are such a fucking disaster that 99.9% of the time I forget to take my pill until I\\'m in the car on the way to work or at work. The people who designed this drug thought someone with ADHD would remember to refill this thing with the drug that would have helped them remember to refill this thing?????? I\\'ve forgotten EVERY TIME it\\'s empty. \\n\\nI\\'m sure some of you can relate to this: At least once a week, I will take my bottle out of bag (when I was on Vyvanse), zone out, and then I come back to reality with the bottle still in my hand and I don\\'t know if I took the pill or not. The one good thing about Adzenys is the evidence of the blister pack the pill was in lmao. \\n\\nTo me, the actual drug itself feels very much like Adderall XR. I can\\'t decide if it has more of a subtle start than Adderall XR or if it\\'s just that the dose isn\\'t enough for me. Adzenys isn\\'t working nearly as well as Vyvanse does for me. The best way I can describe it is spotty. It\\'s like the release of the medication throughout the \"day\" (4-5 hours tops) is all over the place. I\\'ve had 30-45 min spurts where I\\'m able to focus pretty well and then feel an obvious dip. Then 15 min later, I can feel it starting to work a little again but it\\'s foggy. Foggy in that I don\\'t have 9 million things on my mind and I\\'m not restless, but I feel like a shell of myself? That lasts for about 20 min before I can get something done without zoning out 18 times. It\\'s a cycle of that. Vyvanse for me is relatively smooth and steady most days comparably. \\n\\nI also don\\'t know if I\\'m even taking it correctly. Of course with ADHD my mind is wildly overthinking it. Since it feels a little different than Adderall XR, in my opinion, it could very well be the delivery of it. Am I leaving in my mouth long enough? Did I leave it in my mouth too long? Should I swish it around? Would that fuck it up? Btw it tastes like an extra sugary orange sweet tart and the texture once dissolved is gritty and gross. The instructions say to put it on top of your tongue, but every other dissolvable pill goes under so that your mucous membranes can absorb it (but it is extended release so idk!!).  I can\\'t find much info online about dissolvable tablets that are extended release. If anyone has any tips on taking these, pls advise.\\n\\nI\\'ve been on Adzenys for almost 2 months. My doc prescribes my prescriptions in 3 month increments, so I forgot to make an appointment to change back to Vyvanse/Adderall. Go figure. But I will be switching back. Hope my doc enjoys his kickback because I think he was full of shit. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR; If Adderall XR wasn\\'t a good fit for you, Adzenys probably isn\\'t either. Also, it\\'s a dumbass design for a drug for people with ADHD since you have to remember to refill your plastic pack since they can\\'t be stored in a bottle.',\n",

When you observe your thoughts/bodily sensations/etc. you get some distance. This is actually the same as ERP.  You don't need to work out a solution or do something special. You just need to teach your brain that there is nothing wrong with XYZ. I don't know what your fears are. By the way, they are bullshit. It's a bluff, but, a very good one. \\n2. **the sky is blue**. What this means is that your mind may be cloudy, lots of shit going on. But it will clear itself after a while. You don't need to do anything to get it clear. (But: you have to do the work (meditating, exercise, eating healthy, etc.)) This may seem contradicting, but your choices on what to do are of course yours, you decide. To get rid of OCD/Thoughts however, you dont need to do anything, since there is no problem in the first place... Thoughts are ok, any kind. You did not decide to have the thought/sensation/emotion did you? Makes sense?\\n3. Try it **in the morning** after waking up, first thing. Make it a routine. Never skip it. Sets the rest of the day.\\n\\nThose are my 2 cents. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE. I know meditating will seem shitty, hard, not satisfying, etc. Please don't avoid it. Don't avoid to confront your OCD. Trust me I have been there... There is light at the end of the tunnel!\\n\\nPS: If you want to read my story see my other post. I just saw a post here, so I wanted to tell you the one thing that helped me most. Of course there are more factors... But you would only read a clickbait title, no?\\n\\nAlso, if you have never meditated or are confused by the concepts (I was very very confused at the start) try Headspace. They have a phenomenal basics course. Great app.\\n\\nOk. I'm out. Love you all. Please don't avoid it like I did and throw away years of your life. \\n\\nTAKE ACTION! You know the steps, no?\",\n",

Lockdown in my country made everything worse and after a bad incident I start to walk everyday as a coping mechanism and do also some other things. I developed a routine that seemed to made me feel safe but in reality I just developed a very toxic ocd compulsion that I can't get out of it.\\n\\nAlthough I tried through the months to break some of my patterns and after the end of lockdown things got a little bit better, I'm still afraid to get out of this routine. I can realize now that my thoughts are irrational but I can't convince myself to end it. Everyday I have to go out in the cold because I think I will get panicked if I stay in the house or I will do something to harm myself. From the other side I was so bad for so many months, every day I was suicidal and it's like I can't accept that I'm not right now, that I want to end this situation without any dramatic event. Like my suffering was for nothing, it just verify how nonsense was everything I did and how much time I wasted.\\n\\nThe situation is much more complex that just my ocd, is my parents behavior, my social anxiety, my cptsd but the main problem is how everything manifested in ocd rituals. I have spent more than a year sitting every night in my moms car without really understanding anymore why am I doing it and how to stop it.\\n\\nI catch myself to seek everyday more and more other things, I dream the day I will read my books again, I will bullet journaling, I will clean my room, I will put my life in order. A year ago I didn't have the motivation anymore but now I feel that I have it but I can't doing these things because my ocd hold me in fear. I'm afraid that I will end up in worse situation, something bad will happen if I do something for myself, that I don't deserve to get back on life. Everytime I think about doing something I get panicked because I'm afraid that I will get new intrusive thoughts, that I will end up to psychosis. \\n\\nAlso, overanalyzing everything from how I will set up my journal, if I'm normal thinking a certain way and how I should do the x, z, y thing, just confirms my worries. I feel that is better to exhaust myself and not give any stimuli because I protect me. But it's so absurd because I always have in my mind that only a suicide attempt will resolve things. I always think my life after the suicide attempt. It's like I want to resolve all my problems and all my feelings first to start live again.\\n\\nIn the meantime I spent all my days online on my smartphone, since not opening my pc is part of my compulsions, wasting my time here on reddit, watching trash reality TV shows and commenting on Twitter. For months I tried to hold myself for indulge to spiritual stuff again like tarot readings but I get obsessed again. I also indulge completely to reassurance obsessions and magical thinking as coping mechanisms with my whole situation. \\n\\nI really want to know if someone is in the same situation of being consumed in his ocd rituals for months or for years. Most people are writing about the compulsions they had for some weeks or for some hours or about pure ocd. But what can you do when your rituals are interfere in your everyday life and have become so big part of it that you can't just stop them? The biggest problem i think is that I seek  a reason behind my actions, that I want them to matter. To stop them with a dramatic way not just decide to let them. I don't understand really why I have a need like that. Maybe I'm seeking validation from my family and I use this way. I have thought to make something impulsive since I go out every night to not return home, take a bus and go to for a trip in a town near us so I will break the circle. But I'm afraid I will get totally panicked in the process. \\n\\nReally I feel trapped. Is there anyone else who had to deal with something like this and how you dealt with apart from therapy? How you decided one day after a year to just stop something? How you managed to sit with it? Did you had support from someone? Unfortunately my family doesn't understand. Whenever I had a panic attack from my ocd they get irritated with me they don't try to calm me down. The way they help only has a result to enable my compulsions. It's not their fault cause I force them to do certain things but they don't understand that it would be better if they denied them and they don't want to do it because they don't trust me.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Hey, I need some advice from likeminded individuals, because everyone in my life seems to think I’m making a huge mistake. Sorry it’s so long but I feel like there needs to be a lot of context. \\n\\nI desperately want to quit my job, but I’m afraid I’m being impulsive and foolish. I’m working in a TK-2nd grade classroom as a teacher’s aide to my sister in law up in the mountains (that’s why it’s a multi-grade class) where I’m making minimum wage. It’s a tiny school. My main responsibilities are taking the TK and kindergartners into the other classroom to work on packets during work time (feels like herding cats with my brain), while she teaches the first and second graders and I watch the kids at recess. Just trying to focus on everything at once is so exhausting and overwhelming that by the end of each day when I get home I go straight to bed and hybernate. Also, I want to mention that my relationship with my sister in law is a bit lacking. She’s just about as neurotypical as it gets and she just doesn’t get me and my daydreamy whimsical personality (if I may say so). It’s not that I don’t like her, but I’ve noticed that the only time she has an interest in me is when she is drunk. She has resentment towards my boyfriend and I feel that it casts a shadow onto me. She can be set off really easily so I walk on eggshells whenever I talk to her. Add that in with RSD. I’ve had multiple panic attacks since the beginning of the school year because of all this. \\n\\nI’m 23 and until recently, I haven’t been able to figure out what I want to do with my life. I haven’t gone to college yet and I’m not sure if I want to. I’d jump from hyperfixation to hyperfixation (drawing/painting/collage/embroidery/fashion/jewelry/beading/photography/singing) and say “I found the thing I want to do!” But of course I couldn’t stick with it. About a year ago, I decided I wanted to learn to sew and it took until Spring Break of last school year for me to get to it and start learning. I fell in love! I’ve always been interested in fashion design but I didn’t have the drive to really start learning. I spent the summer learning from my grandmother and I was dreading going back to work because I knew my energy would be depleted and I wouldn’t be able to pursue sewing like I had been. \\n\\nI feel like my mental health is failing and I’m never in the moment. I’m dreading tomorrow and the next tomorrow and the next tomorrow and on and on, I’m dissociating whenever I’m at work, and I’m living (barely surviving) for the weekend. \\n\\nSo here’s what I want to do: I want to quit.\\nI’ve been collecting vintage clothes that I find in thrift stores to resell online, but I want to do photo shoots in beautiful landscapes in them to give it a more luxury appeal. And I’d like to embroider art onto certain pieces of clothing (not vintage). I’d be doing this as income while I’m teaching myself to sew. \\n\\nI may have enough money to survive (maybe a couple months) until I get it off the ground, gain a following of my shop, but I’m afraid it won’t work, it’ll take too long or it JUST SIMPLY WON’T work. And then I’ll have to rely on my boyfriend or my mom financially, both who think I’m being foolish. I know I may be, but I feel like I’m going to lose my mind if I don’t quit. \\n\\nShould I quit and follow the dopamine?',\n",

I have patches of dry skin where I tried to pop things that weren’t poppable. My mother just isn’t interested in being in my life anymore, but up until the last two or three months, she was my best friend. Granted we were definitely codependent as fuck but she was my support system, the one and only constant in my life in the last 30 years. She was my lifeline, some days the only thing between myself and absolute rock bottom. My brain won’t register but our relationship isn’t OK right now, it’s registering like she’s..gone. I’m grieving like I’ve lost the most important person in my life. I used to literally imagine the worst day in the world would be the day that she died. My body is physically just shutting down it feels like. Basic functioning like even bandaging my fucking numerous wounds that I literally did to myself, just to reiterate, I’m complaining about something I could definitely prevent. Like I don’t wonder why I have no friends and have lost all my relationships… I know I just thought 20 years of therapy, numerous inpatient and outpatient programs for mental health, I’m just being a fucking smart person in general would keep me afloat. I was fucking wrong. I just lost my job two weeks ago. The most low-key slow burn discrimination ever. I self harmed this job more often than I ever have before. My boss would intentionally trigger me. It’s on camera, him following me when I’m trying to get away from him having a panic attack and he cornered me in the break room. He was just hoping that he could poke a stick in my cage enough to make me break. That’s not exactly how the end played out went, but it was so fucked.\\nEver since I got fired I’ve been self harming so much I got myself a horrible infection. I could afford exactly one doctors appointment, $45 and the antibiotics. Somehow it’s gotten worse since then and my neck looks like I swallowed a golf ball. I have patches of scaly skin, the areas where I picked recently hurt so bad. Like I literally do this to myself. That’s what I don’t get.A psychiatrist I went to one time, probably my favorite, essentially said that my amygdala attacks the rest of my brain and it’s just self sabotage city. Complex PTSD, borderline personality disorder, OCD, ADD, and I think it’s all caught up to me. I have a useless bachelors degree. I love it, but in the Florida Panhandle there’s not exactly a lot of jobs in the history field. I ended up here because of a man, and that ended up being such a traumatic situation four years later I’m still kind of struggling with it even though it’s the tail end. I saw a picture of myself from a couple years ago and had a complete meltdown the other day. I used to be so pretty and I didn’t realize it. Now I’ve got my whole face bandaged up, scars all over me and my inside I guess matches my outside now too. I mean so well. My intentions are truly only to help other people, support those that need it. To be the person that I needed when I was at my lowest for someone else. When theDarkness blocks out the light. People always say let me know if you need anything! I am here for you! But you have to be careful when you say that to me. I’ve had more than a couple men tell me they wanted to marry me… I’m 30 and single so clearly you can see how that worked out. When the rubber hits the road it’s too much. I know my mom is an alcoholic and that’s a mitigating factor in her behavior, but it doesn’t hurt any less.\\nMy cat and my dog are sitting on either side of me and I feel like they’re being nice to each other just to make me feel better. My best friend has been irritated with me and has his own stuff going on which I totally get it, but I’m just so down all the time I the last week or so. I’d be annoyed if I was him too, but he is kind of being a dick.\\nI certainly have made choices that put me where I am, and my eternal struggle is that I blamed everyone else for the first half of my life,but now I just blame myself. Borderline takes over and it’s either one extreme or the other but it comes off sounds like a pity party…but really I’m just getting my thoughts out in order to analyze them. Guess I shouldn’t use other people as sounding boards anymore. I feel like I’m just scared to talk to anyone about anything anymore. I am already in a weird place with a short fuse, if somebody said the wrong thing and it caused friction God knows how upset I would get. I can’t stand crying anymore. The one fucking job interview I’ve had since I got fired – I fucking cried! Fucking cried in the goddamn interview! What the fuck what the actual fuck. Never going back to that store again. I have so much more to say but I’m going to stop. I hate the mobile app and I’m tired of listening to myself talk. I didn’t have the energy to type this but I wanted to get it out. There’s probably a bunch of typos, and it’s rambling..But I just had to get it out somewhere other than Google docs. My heads killing me and I probably need to eat.

As a disclaimer I am on meds for my ADHD. This hack may not be as amazing for people not on meds or have worse focus/discipline issues than I do. With that being said I hope this helps somebody. \\n\\nPROBLEM: Even though my meds help me SO MUCH, I still notice I can hyperfixate on the wrong things. For example, after I take my meds I tend to get sucked into my phone in the mornings when I should be getting ready for work. This would make me run late and was very frustrating for me. Instead of getting upset with myself I decided to look into options to limit my access to nonessential apps, and found a great solution. \\n\\nSOLUTION: On my iPhone I went to my Screen Time settings > down time > schedule and set my schedule for weekdays. From 5 AM to 8 AM I can only access my notes app, messages app, music, fitness and podcast apps. All other apps (including safari) are greyed out on my screen. If I click on one it will tell me I can’t access it until 8 AM. There is a way to override the schedule, but just seeing the locked screen is a great reminder that I SHOULD NOT BE on that app, and I’m able to set my phone down. \\n\\nMy screen time has been down by two hours on average each day and I’ve been on time for work every day. It’s truly a life saver! \\n\\nI love this because it’s completely customizable to YOUR needs. You are able to select your schedule, days, and which apps you want to be able to use. This is much better than those apps that lock your entire phone if you still need to listen to music or podcasts while you do whatever. \\n\\nIf you feel inclined, please share any other phone or tech hacks that have worked well for you!

A symptom of depersonalization is overthinking existentialism, life, reality, identity and all that crap but I was wandering if my psychiatrist might had got something wrong.\\n\\nAt their worst, all of this stuff manifests as an existential anxiety, which means that the idea/concept of being alive causes me intense dread (I had my first panic attack because of this) and you feel trapped in this reality, like being in the matrix. Sometimes tho, if I genuinely feel good, I can easily talk all day about all of these things and be completely fine, so my conclusion is that the thought alone aren\\'t really the main problem; although sometimes I feel ok or neutral and just hearing words that recall topics like politics, economics, world, space, reality and so on can put me into those terrible states.\\n\\nI am worried that some traits of dp may be linked with some kind of OCD and especially that my dp can be actually be a consequence of ocd; here\\'s my doubts:\\n\\n1. are ocd thoughts a limited area even when you are truly happy and peaceful? As I wrote before, sometimes I have no problems in engaging them, but is it the same for ocd?\\n2. there are literally entire days or even weeks in which I feel that my symptoms are mind created because I keep focusing on them and I can\\'t let go. For example for the past days I\\'ve been constantly thinking about myself, my identity, my image at the mirror, how am I from the outside and so on basically non stop, even if I can feel somehow peaceful I can tell that I am not really free 100%, is this a symptom of ocd?\\n3. sometimes I have a feeling that there is something that requires my attention but I can\\'t understand what it is, probably because in first place there isn\\'t even anything actually. It\\'s like having a worm in your mind but you can\\'t pull it out because you can\\'t even comprehend why is there and what is it. It makes me wanna cry but I can\\'t, like if I\\'m having a breakdown, is this a symptom?\\n4. i don\\'t have any physical compulsion but there is a kind of mental thing going on sometimes. Basically when someone talks (video or IRL person or even myself) I visualize a random word they or I used and I start analyzing it and thinking \"why i understand that? what does that mean? why i know how to talk and listen other people? what are words? why humans can talk? this is all fucked up, i can\\'t bear to be alive\" and can cause a very rapid semantic saturation on that word, very  bothersome . Best scenario: I quickly shift my focus to other things or back to the conversation and I forget about all this nonsense. Worst scenario: it snowballs into existential anxiety and deep fear. Can this be considered an obsession?\\n5. if i engage in those thought it just makes everything worse, i don\\'t have any type of relief in talking about those topics, or giving attention to them, or doing the thing described in point 4. Like, all the time I had to bring up those existential stuff during therapy it just increased hugely the anxiety and the general feeling of dpdr',\n",

Securely attached children have confidence that a parent or caregiver will be available to meet their needs and give them comfort when they are distressed.\\n\\n*Avoidant, or insecure-avoidant*\\n\\nAvoidant attachment develops in children who do not experience sensitive responses from a parent or caregiver to their needs or distress. Children with avoidant attachment may become very independent, both physically and emotionally.\\n\\n*Anxious, or insecure-anxious*\\n\\nChildren with anxious attachment do not have consistent responses to their needs from a parent or caregiver. Children with anxious attachment may be clingy around their caregiver while insecure in themselves or in their interactions with others.\\n\\n*Disorganized, or fearful*\\n\\nDisorganized attachment occurs when a child wants love and care from their parent or caregiver but is also afraid of them. Disorganized attachment can develop if a parent or caregiver responds to a child seeking comfort by ignoring, yelling at, or punishing them in some way.\\n\\nIn the book it states on page 116:\\n\"... avoidant toddlers are likely to become adults who are out of touch with their own feelings and those of others.

Medication affects everybody differently, we don’t all end up feeling the same way on medication, and it’s probably going to take some time to find the right meds/dose for me. However, I feel like there’s still enough overlap that ppl w adhd who take the right med/dose for themselves all have a shared experience of how they felt once they finally got medicated. \\n\\nFirst, I’m going to tell you about my ADHD, how I realized I definitely don’t function the way my peers do, and about finally getting diagnosed. For some reason, I feel the need to add as much detail as possible, so feel free to skip that whole section. I’ll put dividers (———) to let you know when that story starts and stops, so you can just skip over it. \\n\\n———————————————————\\n\\nI’m 20 years old, recently got diagnosed with ADHD. I’ve suspected that I’ve had it for a very long time, but it only JUST became way too overwhelming that I had to seek professional help. I started noticing the problem in high school, but it didn’t really impact me that badly. I was a really good student, and I am (and always have been) extremely intelligent for my age. My school system was super structured, and we weren’t allowed to have phones in class or anything like that. So up until I graduated from high school, I literally had no choice but to attend class and pay attention. This was enough for me. The content was easy enough, and I was smart enough, that it literally didn’t matter if I studied or not. Material that the other kids would spend days studying, I would (very poorly) study for a few hours the night before the exam, and I would ace it too. It didn’t matter that I couldn’t bring myself to study even if I wanted to. I was doing just fine. I mean, sure, my desk was always a mess, I obsessively created lists and schedules and calendars and study plans but could never stick to them, I was extremely talkative, I often found myself heavily procrastinating even though I actually wanted to study (despite not needing to) because yes, I was mostly acing things, but I had the capacity for 100% on those tests for sure, and I wanted that 100% (perfectionism am I right). But despite all of that, I was doing fine academically, so I figured I was okay. \\n\\nThen, I got to university. First semester was fine, good actually. I was taking really fundamental courses for my major so it was never anything too foreign or new for me, attending class was enough for me to retain the information I needed to get straight As. I slept a decent amount (not perfect, but it wasn’t too bad, around 5-7 hours on the weekdays, and then a good 9 on the weekends). I even managed to make time for the gym, which was super great. And then, second semester, covid happened. And we went online. And god. I could not recover from that one bit. I never attended class, looked up the answers to all my homework, never submitted anything over 5 minutes before the deadline, and god knows how I didn’t fail every single course for the last 3 semesters, because I have seriously retained 0 information. One class, I almost failed. My final was 60% of my grade and the only “studying” I could bring myself to do was watch a whole semester’s worth of lectures on 3x speed 2 days prior. That is not how a typical mechanical engineering student is supposed to study. Not at all. Especially not if they want to succeed. Anyway, needless to say, I did so bad in that class. This was extremely depressing for me because, not to get cocky but, I know I’m smart. My entire life I have scored in the top 1-2% of literally everything. In school (I was actually valedictorian), standardized tests, ACTUAL iq tests, everything. I know I’m capable of mastering pretty much anything I want to learn. But I just couldn’t. And what made me feel even worse was how everybody I knew adapted at least a little bit to online life, but I just couldn’t. I would sit for hours and try to bring myself to work, but I just felt paralyzed.\\n\\n———————————————————-\\n\\nFast forward to today. New semester, harder courses, and I’m still no better. A whole summer passed by and I still couldn’t figure out how to manage my symptoms. I finally went to get diagnosed. No surprise, pretty severe ADHD. Got prescribed adderall. \\n\\nI read so much about how everybody talks about their medication being one of the best decisions they’ve made (considering they responsibly use them), and I got excited to finally see if this was going to help me. \\n\\nI should note, I never intend on abusing this medication, and I don’t even want to use it in the long run. I only want to use medication long enough to get myself on track and be productive enough to create a routine where I can get my work done, so that I can sleep at reasonable times and make time for the gym. Once I get to that point, I intend on slowly getting off of medication while maintaining that desired routine. \\n\\nThe doctor prescribed 5mg IR and 10mg XR. I’d take XR in the early morning (around 7:30am. NEVER after 9), and then IR in the evening (NEVER after 6:30). Honestly, the first time I took it was the only time I ever actually felt it. I stayed up for about 23 hours with only 3.5 hours of sleep the night before, for example. When I took it that first time, I was still procrastinating like my normal self, but I noticed that when I directed my attention towards the stuff I should have been studying, I could actually process what I was reading, which was great! The medication was hit or miss for me for about 2 weeks though. Sometimes I’d feel it //just// enough to get myself to do a few hours of work. Others, I would feel no different than usual. Not even a little bit. After 2 weeks, my doc upped my dose. 10mg IR and 20mg XR. 30mg total per day. It literally feels no different than the 5 and 10, and those just barely made a difference for me to begin with. I just don’t seem to be experiencing anything that’s associated w being on adderall. I could take 10mg IR and easily sleep 2 hours later. My appetite is the same (although, I have a poor appetite to begin with). I don’t get a dry mouth. My heart rate has not changed. I don’t feel particularly focused. My mind isn’t SUPER clear, just a little bit better than before, which is something I guess. I just don’t feel anything I think I’m supposed to. People that I know who also have pretty bad adhd felt it pretty strongly at 10mg IR twice a day. I do 30mg Adderall a day total and I’m, I don’t know, just the same. Is that normal? Is it possible that adderall just doesn’t affect me? I know people have preferences for different medications, but isnt that usually because the side effects of, adderall for example, are just so bad that they switch medications? My issue is I’m not feeling anything. And honestly increasing my dose to 40mg a day sounds scary to me. Considering doubling from 15 to 30 did nothing, would I even expect to get to the functional point I want to be at if I took 40? Yes, the medication is doing //something//, but I know I’m still way behind in terms of functioning the way people usually do when they don’t have ADHD. I don’t know. Does anyone else have experiences like this? Would it be possible that a slight increase in dosage would change the world for me? It just seems crazy for me to think that 30mg all feels the same, but that extra 10mg everyday makes all the difference. If anyone has experienced something like that, I’d really appreciate you sharing. I’m just worried that this medication either isn’t working and I’ll never be able to become functional, or that I need a super high dose (which honestly terrifies me).\\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nSevere ADHD. Started on 5mg IR 10mg XR, 15mg total per day. Helped a tiny bit. Felt it the most only on the first try. Recently upped my dose to 10mg IR 20mg XR and feel no different. Is this normal, and would a slight increase (to no more than 40mg per day) make all the difference in the world? Feel free to share your experiences, because I don’t experience any typical feelings associated w adderall. No issues sleeping, no super high levels of focus, appetite is the same, no dry mouth, and heart rate has not changed. Super confused.',\n",

I know inside that I'm not all the things I accused me I'm but I can't convince my mind. And the worst is that I can't share my deep thoughts with anyone. Because people will misundestand them.

This story begins with me forgetting to take my medication this morning. Immediate recipe for disaster.\\n\\nLike I mentioned, I’m currently on vacation with my fiancé’s family (we were in Daytona for his sisters wedding) and as today is our last day here we decided to take a tour of the Daytona Speedway. This was particularly special for me as my dad used to be a race car driver in his prime and is a lifelong racing fanatic (he gave his firstborn son the middle name “Andretti”). He unfortunately doesn’t have a visa so can’t come see it himself, so I wanted to do it for him.\\n\\nThe tour starts and everything is well and good, I’m getting great pictures and we’re all having a fun time. Then, the guide stops the truck and takes us up into the stands. Before he actually lets us go, he tells the group, “If you want to actually *sit* in the seats, please go *down*, do *not* go up. The seats above us only get pressure washed once a month or so and are usually covered in bird poop.”\\n\\nHere comes my current reason for wanting to not exist.\\n\\nI took his words *very* literally. In my mind, I understood this to mean that we couldn’t go upstairs if we wanted to SIT. Otherwise, it was fair game. And I didn’t want to sit down, I just wanted a nice picture of the track for my dad. I just had to watch where I was stepping.\\n\\nSo he let us go and I headed up the stairs. There was actually no bird poop that I could see. I was in the middle of a *beautiful* panorama shot when I heard a *very* annoyed voice say “Ma’am, I specifically said NOT to go up the stairs.” I immediately put my phone down and joined everyone else on the lower level, refusing to make eye contact with anyone.\\n\\nAs we were walking back to the trolley, my fiancé’s mom came up beside me and whispered, “why did you go up?” I explained that I genuinely thought he just meant we couldn’t go up if we wanted to sit in the seats, which I didn’t. She nodded her head and the rest of the tour continued without further incident, but for the past 7 hours the only thought in my head has been “everyone thinks I’m either a spoiled brat that does whatever she wants, or a complete moron.”\\n\\nLooking back, I *do* feel like a total idiot. I should have realized that no one else was on the upper levels. I should have understood what the guide meant. The worst part is, my fiancé *tried* to stop me. But I insisted that I didn’t want to sit down so it was fine. And now I feel like he’s upset with me because he had gone up there with me, to stop me, and the guide got annoyed with him as well. I want to talk to him or *someone* about it and at least explain myself but my debilitating fear of rejection won’t let me.\\n\\nI just feel so stupid and all I want to do is go home now. Vacation is ruined. And I can’t even think about one day taking my dad to see the track because I know I’m *never* going back there again. All because I have the critical thinking skills of a newborn.',\n",

I keep thinking that I am sick/infected a couple times a week. I keep wanting a COVID test even enough I am in a city that has had almost no cases of COVID (in Australia). As we are trying for COVID zero, the fear of one person not doing the right thing is crippling to me. \\n\\nI am on immunosuppressive meds meaning I am more likely to get a cold, which doesn't help. I am more concerned with mean spreading things. Also, no mask mandates where I live, and if you wear one out of fear, everyone looks at you as if you are a leper. I also work on a lab in an intense career as a research scientist, so work from home is only an occasional option. \\n\\nMy OCD started before COVID around food poisoning fear but the rituals got worse now around trying to avoid colds. Last week, after recovering from a minor suspected cold, I started to do stuff as part of my ERP. I ate in my local favourite cafe, using utensils from the communal tray. I got on the bus and went shopping in town. I filled my water bottle from the fountain at work without washing my hands immediately afterwards. I was proud and wrong this down for my therapist, as she had advised. \\n\\nNow I am home sick with a fever and my wife is worse. She might have picked it up and passed it to me (she had Friday off after an intense work week and went shopping, including IKEA). I feel rubbish and I am delaying my science AGAIN because I am sick AGAIN. \\n\\nSo is it paranoia if everyone is out to get me. I started feeling like there were colds and infections around every corner and I wanted to avoid them, but here I am proven right. My doctor told me today he's been seeing SOOO many cases like ours of infections (except flu and COVID). So how do I go forward? I am at a loss. I feel like the SSRI I started two months ago has helped, but this is just awful. I wish other people took colds during the pandemic as seriously as I do now, especially for the immunosuppressed out here.\",\n",

They were embarrassed by me at times and appalled by some of my behavior. I could never understand why. By the time I got to my 20s there was a lot of damage done to our relationship and my self esteem. I actually moved to another country and recreated my own life trying to get away from the framework they have built for me. I still cant seem to escape my past / my childhood. I feel like theyve robbed me from a supportive childhood and just made things worse by blaming me for my behaviour instead of helping me. \\n\\nIs it bad that I'm struggling so much to move past this? Im at a point where I struggle to talk to them at all because it just triggers me all over again. I struggle with day to day life. Its exhausting but I never get any support / understanding from them which just makes it even harder. I feel really lonely. How do I get past this?\\n\\n***update: thank you so much for all the comments. I appreciate every poing of view and like reading about your experiences as well. Makes me feel less lonely. I read every single one. Ill definitely look into therapy like suggested. It probably would have been easier to forgive if they got onboard after my diagnosis, but last week I got a typical response as I would've when I was a teen to a current situation in my life that causes me pain and they just brush it off like Im over dramatic amd embarrassing and the entire wall just finally came down. Reading all the responses really helped\",\n",

Words can’t help. Meds can’t help either. Been on dozens and dozens of the fucking things. They do nothing, nothing at all. Not even one measly fucking side effect. Doesn’t matter if it’s antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, they’re all the fucking same, they do nothing.\\n\\nTherapists just end up throwing their hands up after long enough. They can’t help me, don’t know how I guess. Think my GP is getting to the same point after years of throwing meds at me and having them do nothing. Wonder if she even believes me.\\n\\nIt’s not like I don’t try. I still manage to exercise every day, still manage to cook for myself even though I never want to eat, still manage to at least try to do hobbies, even if they just frustrate me too much now cause I can’t focus. I’ve really tried all the suggestions too. Meditation, mindfulness, breathing exercises, journaling and all that shit, I mean fuck, I *wanted* it work. But none of it fucking does. Not one bit. \\n\\nKicked my addictions too, for all the fucking good it did. Haven’t done drugs for 6 months, haven’t self-harmed for 4 months, haven’t had alcohol for 3 months. Doesn’t make any difference though. Only became an addict cause none of treatments were working. Just said fuck it and started set-medicating instead. Did it help? Not really, but it did make me numb. Liked being numb. Passed the time at least, made me feel like I didn’t have to rush towards dying, might just be able to wait for it to happen on it own. But now I’ve stopped cause two people I’ll tentatively say were friends convinced me to. But then they fucked off outta my life and I relapsed. Didn’t last long cause now it pumps me full of so much guilt I don’t even have the option of getting numb anymore. So I’ve stopped for good, I guess. And people pat you on the fucking back over it, acting like it matters at all. Acting like you’re out the other side of hell, even though you’re stuck in the worst hell you’ve ever been in cause now you have zero solutions just like before, but less options. Tell you “you should be proud” like you can even feel proud. Like them saying they’re proud or that you should be means anything to me, like it fucking translates at all.\\n\\nUsed to at least want things. Now I don’t even fucking care. Used to want to have someone to end the crippling fucking loneliness. Knew I couldn’t get it because I can’t connect with people, don’t even know why, just can’t. Knew people always just made me feel *more* alone. But I still wanted *someone*, even if it was a pipe dream. But now I don’t fucking care. Sounds like effort, energy I just don’t have. Couldn’t have friends or a girlfriend anyway. Too unstable. Who wants to be around someone who can go from being fine the last time you spoke to them to being completely fucked and suicidal the next? And even when I’m “fine” now, it just an act, a fucking facade that eventually I won’t have the energy to keep up. Been years since I was anything but horrifically, suicidally depressed. Probably good I can’t connect to people.\\n\\nAnyway don’t even know why I’m bothering to type this. No therapist or medication can help, no one here’s gonna be able to. Guess it’s just to vent. To just announce I’ve given up. Tried to get my meds today, got told they’re “not covered” by my pension card. Would’ve cost me $40 for 28 days worth. Can’t afford it. Just fucking broke. One of the side effects of my diseased brain, can’t hold down a fucking job. Working for more than about 6 months either makes me so depressed I start self-harming, drinking or having suicide attempts, makes me catatonically dissociative so I barely know where I am and can’t hear people talking to me or it just puts me into a full-blown psychosis. Either way, the result is the same, either get fired or have to quit. So my bank accounts are empty from all the failed treatments and worthless medications. So I’m just stopping, don’t really have a choice. Just not renewing my scripts. Coming off the meds, don’t give a shit if I’m on the highest dose for both. Don’t have a choice. I just fucking give up.',\n",

I have never shared my story with anyone before, not even my long term boyfriend who I love and trust very much. After much procrastination, I finally decided it was time to set up an appointment with my college’s therapist. I went in today, and he made me feel really welcomed and safe and listened to. I shared all of my compulsions, my intrusive thoughts, my checking and contamination fears, my experiences, how those things make me feel, etc. It was incredibly emotional and I cried at times. But god, it felt so good and freeing to finally get those thoughts out and share it with someone. He asked me thoughtful questions, reassured me, and engaged me in good conversation and self reflection. At the end of the appointment, he said I gave him alot of material to work with in the future and that he will come up with a plan on how to best address my therapy and needs, something about cognitive behavioral therapy I think? As well as setting me up with a psychiatrist to get an official diagnosis and discuss medication. I just feel like this is the first step in the right direction for me to getting better.

Intentionally cut up other people's clothes to make cool clothing for themself out of it. Stabbed their leg in a culvert. Dropped their phone and broke it to uselessness (screen was already broken) just yesterday.\\n\\nI could go on about 5 or 10 times longer than that with just things in recent memory. It's such a huge drain on our family in raw monetary terms, and the emotional tax when it's things that can't be simply replaced with money is enormous too.\\n\\nWhen they were younger, say a couple years ago, I thought they could learn to be better and were just being reckless and inconsiderate.

However, I can break from this quite easily depending on the day. And lastly I have to check the whole house 5+ times over if I’m the last one to leave for the day (checking all doors are locked, dogs have food and water, plugs turned off etc.)\\n\\nThe main one I wanted to talk about is the creating new usernames/accounts and then hating the name because it’s not perfect thing. I make YouTube videos sometimes but it’s always been an on and off thing and I’ve never made more than 10 videos on a channel due to my OCD. I see that some people have said they made 80 accounts per year, whereas I’ve only made about 20-30 new emails & YouTube channels in my whole life.\\n\\nDo this sound like I have only a mild form of OCD? It’s not something that absolutely cripples me which I’m thankful for but it can slow down processes or things I’m doing or demotivate me.',\n",

My adhd is not good at handling change in my environment.\\n\\nI\\'m a manager at a mfrg company and have shared my concerns with my boss among many others...with the overwork and the fact that my job has regressed to very basic, non-challenging work. It is so mundane I can barely stand it. \\n\\nI went above and beyond to share information with my team via email and my boss replies \"thank you. Can you schedule separate meetings to discuss each product.\" That would be 8 mtgs I have to schedule for doing something I didn\\'t have to do. I would not be as angry if my boss had not said at a prior meeting that a new manager would be in charge of product launches and these are \"products launch\" mtgs.\\n\\nSide note. There is a problem at my workwith female employees getting stuck with all the admin and organizing-type work....and also not being taken seriously which i\\'m not imagining as othes have complained.

              " {'sequence': 'I\\'ve lived my entire life being incredibly anxious, and having some what of an obsessive personality. But I\\'ve never had any classic compulsions that I was aware of other than BFRBs (picking my thumb skin, inflicting minor pain on my extremities). My older sister has autism and diagnosed OCD, she not only has rituals and intrusive thoughts, but also carried out compulsive behaviours, so I always thought that because I saw what OCD looked like in her, I knew I didn\\'t have it\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'m now 27, and I\\'m really questioning now if that\\'s true. I\\'m aware that this sub can\\'t diagnose me, but I think general conformational experience will make me feel less alone. I\\'ve been in and out of therapists, psychiatry, and am currently on 60mg of Prozac but nothing has ever been that helpful. I\\'m officially diagnosed with GAD, ADHD, Panic disorder and as far as a formal diagnosis that\\'s it. A therapist I had recently told me she was going to treat me for PTSD based off of experiences of things I\\'ve told her. I\\'ve had a long string of not so favourable sexual experiences since I was 14 years old, because of how I would spend my time. I never felt particularly traumatized, but I\\'ve spent a long time feeling obsessed over my negative experiences. \\n\\nAs a child I was completely death obsessed. I would have panic attacks regularly about my mortality at like, 6 years old and younger. I even famously wrote my own will when I had gotten lotion in my mouth, thinking it\\'d kill me. I had not experienced any death around me, so I have no idea where it came from. Along with that, I\\'ve always been a major hypochondriac. A selective hypochondriac though, because I am also extremely messy and have historically had a hard time with hygiene upkeep. But having unhealthy habits by choice never stopped me from freaking out about its potential results. I\\'ve been to medical doctors consistently over my life, for any small ache or pain from worry my body is shutting down. (My parents always joked about how I\\'m like Bob Wiley from \"What About Bob?\" ) I\\'ve never been told I had anything, other than now a mild rise in my cholesterol. \\n\\nWith these obsessive death and mortality thoughts, I also have other constant intrusive thoughts. A lot of them in my life have been intrusive sexual thoughts. I have a great relationship with my family, and have no memory of being sexually abused as a child by an adult but I\\'ve always had intrusive thoughts telling me I was sexually abused by any male family member and I simply can\\'t remember. I highly doubt that, and I did have \"sexual experimentation\" with other family members who were children that I am not entirely fond of, but that\\'s to the extent of that pre-14. \\n\\nI had been overly obsessed with boys since I was little also. I always wanted a boyfriend as my #1 life priority. I used to beat myself up over not being pretty enough, I think that\\'s maybe a kind of standard little girl thing, but I would have like a new crush every school year when I was in elementary school. That seems really mild and unimportant, but I even forced myself to like some boys in my class because without a person to concentrate my obsessive thoughts over I felt mostly lost. I finally got a boyfriend in 9th grade when I was 14, and the rest was inevitable. I had boyfriend after boyfriend after boyfriend in a long string for years. I met up with adults and had sexual encounters with them, too. As a teen I was really wanting to be desired, so I tried to do as much as I possibly could. I binged that behaviour like I binge most any other behaviours in my life. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBut honestly my obsession with people doesn\\'t stop at just romantic prospects. Although I am awkward in friendships, I do love to observe people from a distance as much as possible. I love looking into people\\'s windows when I drive by to see what they are doing and spend a lot of time thinking about that. I feel like I\\'m never truly present in this world, that I\\'m always deep in my own head about myself or deep in my own head about someone else\\'s life. I don\\'t know if that\\'s maladaptive daydreaming or what, but it is time consuming. These facets of my life have made living a normal life very difficult for me. I struggled severely through school because I couldn\\'t be present in the moment. And am still struggling through college having gone off and on. I struggle in careers because my poor impulse control and paranoia will let me just call out sick more often than not, or say \"screw it I quit.\" Most times I wish I wasn\\'t alive, not that I want to kill myself because I feel like 1. It\\'d be unimaginably painful 2. It was deeply hurt the people I care a lot about so I feel like I could never. So I\\'m also often known for sleeping a lot, and I really do enjoy sleep the most. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnd now, as a 27 year old, I feel like I obsessively hoard my life\\'s memories, whether good or bad. I feel like when I\\'m truly upset I have chronic childhood nostalgia that makes me feel worse, and on an average day I just can\\'t stop thinking about any given time in my life. Everything reminds me of everything. I tell the same stories 100 times, I write about them 100 times, I\\'m constantly thinking of everything I have been through in its totality. That\\'s why when I talked to my therapist and she asked to discuss my \"trauma\", it just felt like a normal thing to do, because I had already done it so often. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI do now heavily consider that this is some form of OCD, although I am not sure of that fact. I am looking to possibly get a psychiatric re-evaluation because I\\'ve been with the same psychiatrist since I was in middle school, but I\\'m without insurance and a job currently, so I can\\'t really afford it at the moment. \\n\\nCurrently I am in obsessively worrying overload, with COVID, my grandma dying, my other grandma sick, and my dad just not being in general good health. I\\'m worrying about my declining health while simultaneously not doing much to help myself. I need to eat better and exercise, and sometimes I\\'ll do some of that, but most of the time I\\'ll lay on the couch and play games and sleep because I\\'m constantly feeling like I\\'m on edge. There never seems to be a real break, even when I have all the free time in the world. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI don\\'t know what I do from here. I honestly feel directionless and like I\\'m struggling just to get through each day alive',\n",

When I hear that someone is sick, I clean the things that I think they may have touched, I wash my hands a lot, and keep my distance from them even after they’re no longer sick. That’s just how I’ve always been.\\n\\nHowever, for the past few years it’s been different. I wash my hands a million times a day. Like my hands are so raw, cracked, and bleeding. After I wash my hands, I’m careful with what I touch and if I touch something that for some reason I believe to be contaminated (like a pen at work or the door knob to my own apartment) I wash my hands immediately after touching it. It’s an all day thing. If my coworker touches my arm, I wash that part of my arm as well as my hands. When I wash my hands, if my hand touches the sink then I have to start all over. If I’m in the bedroom and I hear my boyfriend sneeze in the living room, I have to wipe down everything in the living room because I’ll be convinced that he didn’t cover his mouth and I can’t feel better until I’ve disinfected everything that I think he may have sneezed on. I’m constantly cleaning because I feel like nothing is ever really clean. It’s exhausting, but I can’t stop my thoughts no matter how much I want to. And I can’t stop cleaning and washing.\\n\\nI’ve been dealing with my symptoms for years and they’ve slowly gotten worse. I’m literally crying as I write this because I just spent 3 hours cleaning and all I want to do is vacuum my apartment, but I can’t because my boyfriend wants to go to bed.

I know this is a poor mentality to have and im working to make it better, but the whole time she kept asking me if i thought point #2 was actually adhd related and if those were just things about myself that are separate. She asked me thing like 4 or 5 time in the 45 mins we met for and never really addressed it at all just moved on to something else. \\n\\nI guess my question would be was I wrong to bring that up or to contribute those things about myself to my adhd. The only purpose of having those two coaches is because they specialize in adhd so im sure their very knowledgeable on the subject matter and have met with a lot of people.

An even number is the x the odd the y. The even number is no the odd is yes. If I see a red car is the x, if I count 10 dogs is the y and the list goes on. At this point I use this method for making a conversation with myself. To reassure my thoughts. It goes like \"I have right about it hah?\" and the number give me the confirmation. I should do this?, one day this will happen etc. \\n\\nSome people think that this is way to just express my intuition because I don\\'t trust myself. Sometimes I get confused because I really need this thing as a stimuli and it gives me pleasure not anxiety. I wonder if it\\'s and adhd thing and I try to pace myself and put my thoughts in order with this way.\\n\\nBut the problem is that in difficult situations this really interferes in my life and I can\\'t stop it because I\\'m doing it unsubconsciously. Even now my mind immediately thought that if I receive a certain number of likes it will mean something specific. It\\'s literary everywhere and with everything and I don\\'t know how to stop it. It\\'s not that I will follow the result everytime or I will remember what my question was, probably I will make the same question a thousand times again in the future.\\n\\nI\\'m very ashamed for my actions and I feel like a stupid child when I\\'m almost 30. Sometimes I even try to make instant future predictions to find the method who gives me the most accurate answers. Sometimes is a mental game who comforts me but sooner or later is turned in an abusive trap who make me feel completely desperate and delusional.',\n",

This is the second cold he has had in two months and this is a trend we are stating to notice.

But I just struggle so much to do the work without addressing my issues. I suffer from complete disassociation from my work because the pain is so intense. It hasn't always been this way by the way -- this is the first time I have been completely immobilized. It started when I started this program.\\n\\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for how to get something done despite the extreme difficulty of doing so?\",\n",

I got married, completed a bachelor's degree, got a full time job that is great. I moved into a duplex, upgraded my college car to something nice and changed most of my wardrobe. I no longer live paycheck to paycheck. My spouse just graduated from college himself. It seems like things would be looking up.

So, I gained 15 lbs over my college experience. Yes, my mom HAD to let me know. I would proceed to gain another 15 lbs. Also, I wasn't cleaning my apartment the way she would prefer. In the early years of being married, my mom had to let me know how messy and disgusting my apartment was. To this day, she would probably think my house is f\\\\*cking messy. Also, she would have preferred I stayed out of debt, to even buy a car or even go to school. As she was probably right, I unknowingly went into a 'massive' amount of credit card debt. It's credit card debt that my debt now would laugh at. As much as I tried, I couldn't pay it off and it was the start of most of my fights I had with my spouse but it was in his name. Also, at the time, she would constantly complain that I wasn't seeing her enough. Not to mention I was trying to find time workout, clean my apartment, pay off my credit card debt AND attend classes AND work at my part time job **AND** try to build a successful marriage with my partner. \\n\\nIt just felt like nothing I could do would make her happy. So, I cut her out of my life. She is a toxic person so it was probably for the better. I actually probably can make her happy but her values and my values are different. I value my partner, my job, and, at the time of school, my education. I also value being able to come home and have the free time to do what I want. I made a decision a long time ago that I would rather put my values before hers. However, 20 years of being taught to act a certain way can't just be magically undone.\\n\\nSo, even if I look at my life and look at the things I wanted, I just see a fat, ugly, disgusting person who is a failure.

And yet again, I now feel little to anything from the medication. This new dose is far less effective than the success I had from the previous dose, but my body has built a tolerance so that the first dose no longer works.\\n\\nI have an appointment with my Dr tomorrow to discuss my medication and just really hope I can find something that allows me to stay positive, focused, calm, aware...not tired, forgetful, zoned out and angry.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Hey friends. Fair warning this is going to be me venting, I have a lot I want to get off my chest and I feel like this community has the only people in the world who might be able to understand or are experiencing something similar. I’m bad at articulating so this might not come out great but here goes. \\n\\nI just turned 25 and I have a lot of good things going for me. I’ve been told by strangers I’m quite attractive (looks, not personality), I’m in excellent physical condition, have a good job, loving family, successful amateur kickboxing side quest (my main special interest), and a couple of people I can call friends. I’m saying this because I don’t want to get too negative with this post, I know a lot of people have it worse so I need to be grateful. \\n\\nWith that being said, I truly feel like an alien pretending to be a human when interacting with people. Nobody in my life knows I’m on the spectrum, but I have a feeling people know something is off. I am extremely lonely and find  that making genuine friends or finding a romantic partner is near impossible. I simply don’t understand social situations and find putting on my persona so taxing that I have to limit my social interactions so that I don’t get burnt out. When I do work up the courage to meet with work friends or talk to strangers, it goes so poorly that I want to curl up into a ball and never leave my flat again. It’s very disheartening because even though I look approachable and put so much effort into my looks, I can’t change who I am or maintain a good enough persona. I remember one time this cute girl came up to me in a coffee shop and started talking to me. I could tell she was interested in me, but it only took a minute of conversing for her demeanor to do a complete 180. This happens often and it’s extremely demoralizing. People just expect you to be normal. Dating is even worse, as looks can only get you so far. I’ve had a couple girlfriends, but once they get to know me they leave. The only person who truly understood me and loved me for who I was, left the country last year for work. This has been heartbreaking. It sucks because I long for a physical and emotional connection with someone, but it has become so hard to find that since leaving uni and even then it was hard. I’ve tried online dating, but I’m absolutely horrified of being in pictures, so there are only a handful of pictures to choose from. The matches I’ve gotten have either ghosted me, or stopped talking to me after the first date.  \\n\\nThe advice I have gotten from normal people and therapists has been annoying too. “Just put yourself out there” “just do things you’re interested in with other people” “just be yourself and the right people will find you”. I interact with plenty of people everyday either at work, at the gym, or at kickboxing classes. I cross nobody’s mind as being a potential friend/partner/acquaintance once they’ve gotten a conversation in with me. Whenever I try to work on my social skills or improve my situation, life picks me up and slams me onto the ground. I have never given up on anything in life and am determined to keep going and keep fighting, but deep down I can’t wait until the day I don’t wake up. Until then, I will continue to be there for my family and try to be there for my friends as family/friends are the only people who have shown me love. \\n\\nIf you’ve made it this far, your eyes are probably bleeding so sorry about that. I’ve just read over everything and as expected, it’s come out poorly. You all mean so much to me and being a part of this community and reading your posts have helped me. I know this has been long, but I don’t really know what to do anymore. I don’t know if I should keep living the life I am living, or if I should isolate myself in a cabin somewhere away from everyone lol. If anyone is going through something similar know that you aren’t alone, and if anyone has been where I am before and wants to offer advice or their stories I’d really want to hear it. \\n\\nThanks everyone :)',\n",

Three days ago, my roommate and I found a stray cat in a nearby neighborhood. We spoke to people in the neighborhood and got him scanned for a microchip to make sure he was actually a stray. After some deliberation, we decided to take him home and figure out if we could get him into the no-kill shelter here (they go by appointment-only so no drop offs). We have a young cat but we decided to keep the stray in the bathroom. Well, I obviously would not have brought home a cat if I thought he had fleas. I really thought you would be able to clearly see fleas on a cat like in cartoons. But the day after, we gave him a flea bath to be safe and sprayed him with repellent and I found about a dozen fleas, dead and alive. I started absolutely freaking out. I got him a prescription for medicine and dewormer and a flea collar for my kitty, AND applied a topical medicine, which now I’m worried was too much because she’s only nine months old. I feel like a horrible cat mom. I’ve vacuumed the bathroom, sprayed lavender, and washed all the towels in the bathroom, but I feel like the fleas and eggs are everywhere. And I’m panicking so much that my kitty is going to get fleas, and that the eggs are all over my clothes because I put some clothing in the closet that hadn’t been washed(but didn’t come into contact with the stray.) The stray has only been in the bathroom all weekend, but my kitty snuck in and now I’m terrified. He doesn’t even seem to have any more fleas but I can’t sleep and my anxiety is so bad that I had my roommate carry me from the shower to my bedroom TWICE because I feel like I’m going to have flea eggs on my feet. Please please please comment anything to help.',\n",

My mind just feels like it's in some super fast void where I can't even think straight anymore, like I feel sick and just want everything over with.  I had to move away to continue living with my toxic family that I hate living with, they're so messy, irresponsible, and constantly against everything I do.  We had to move because of a hurricane that destroyed my dad's last job, and I was originally going to live on my own in town but covid hit and lost literally all the money I was making as a server.  It was no longer a reliable income, so I had no choice but to leave.  In the process of leaving, I had to leave everything I loved behind.  I had friends that I had known since 1st grade that I hung out with every weekend.  It's been a year since I've moved and it's extremely lonely.  I'm in an online college and I've tried applying for jobs but I was declined for all of them.  I literally haven't met a single person here, I just spend every day of my life in my room doing nothing now.  I visited my friends over the summer and started dating a close friend that I had known for 5 years.  We were okay with the distance and I would plan for trips every 2 months.  That summer was the happiest I had been in a very long time, and I absolutely loved my girlfriend.  I was actually excited for my future and moving back after finishing up my college work in a year.  4 months later, she broke up with me because she was stressed out with her University and wanted to figure herself out.  I was of course crushed by it, but I figured we could go back to being close friends like we were, because I REALLY loved our friendship, I talked to her almost every day for 5 years.  Things haven't been working out tho and our friendship was completely ruined, she treated me like shit afterwards and even admitted to it and I'm no longer comfortable even talking to her.  I felt like I lost my best friend for literally nothing, as we had never argued before the breakup and were both doing fine together.  To make it worse, she decided to join my friend group, and now joins the discord every single day.  I now have to avoid the only thing I had left, and that was my friends.  I didn't want to be around them when she's there, she's literally always there.  What she did to me was just so traumatic and I can't escape from it.  They get along with her and have been inviting her to everything, I just feel like I'm getting replaced with her in my group.  I want her gone, I want the pain to end.  Ever since she left, I felt even worse than I did before dating her.  I'm completely alone, and she made me feel worthless.  I lost my girlfriend, I have to avoid my friends, my family hates me.  I have no interests in any hobbies, I can't even decide what I want to do for my major, as I've changed it 3 times now, and no job.  I just spend my days, alone in my room.  Mostly sleeping for 12 hours a day, constantly crying, feeling like I'm slowly dying and have been doing this for months.  I'm just done with this.\",\n",

I\\'ll see a decent (I hope) psychiatrist in SIX (6) months for my problems (I am still undiagnosed) and I have a lot of questions regarding ADHD and ways of coping with it without meds. But first, I want to put some context, so I can explain my questions better (if you do not want to read, just go and read the TL;DR); when I was a child I really liked science and for that reason I excelled in my school science and maths exams. However, I still had average or bad grades overall. And a teahcer even thought I had learning/social problems, reason why I did go to a pshycologist that actually believed I was \"a genius\" (I am quoting literally, this is not a joke lmao). However, she did not diagnosed me with anything and I stopped to go. A lot of years later I was going to the exact same psychologist for sadness and social problems (I cried a lot, sadness withour reason, etc. But I am alright now -- I now wonder if there are mood problems associeted with ADHD because I had similar things in every year of my adolescence, like a cycle of feeling good and bad, and I am very sesitive, everything affects me lmao). She didn\\'t help with anything but after a year I was cool. However, when I talked with her about my daydreaming problems (is daydreamind an ADHD problem or that\\'s actually normal human behaviour? I think I do it A LOT and can\\'t stop, but I do not know when it goes from being normal to a mental problem), that I was failing my assignments (I am now in college) she downplayed the severity of the problem and said it was because I \"didn\\'t care\", when I told her I was distracted by other things, like reading a book, she said I *actually* didn\\'t care and better go read a novel (I was reading a philosophy book). He also yelled at me that I didn\\'t have ADHD (I never talked about it), because if I did I would have been diagnosed as a child, he told me that someone with the disorder wouldn\\'t have read what I read. My question is, then, how do I distinguish desinterest or lazyness from ADHD? In the next session, well, I\\'ll summarize that she believes hypersensivity is bad for some things but \"when I grow up I\\'ll realize it is good in others\", and I found out she is a psychoanalyst and doesn\\'t believe there is such a thing as ADHD because \"we are all different\" and stuff like that. Needless to say, I stopped going, saw a doctor who told me I might have \"ADHD but it was functional\", gave me an appointment for the receiving committee, where I was given an appointment to the psychiatrist \"for anxiety\". From there to having to wait six freaking months to see a decent professional. i want to start my next year of college with less problems, and since I need to wait 6 months I will start with them. How I am supposed to cope daydreaming or doing useless stuff? Also, are there screen time problems associeted or can I blame them instead? I use a lot my cellphone because I feel bored without it and I just scroll for a long time without doing anything. My psychiatrist also blamed it for my sleeping problems.  \\nI feel like I need someone to relate with my experience with that psychologist and yadda yadda and that\\'s the reason I posted all that tale lmao feel free to delete if useless to the sub. Sorry if that is a lot of verbiage. And sorry, also, for my English.\\n\\nI summarize the questions;\\n\\nTL;DR: 1) How do you distinguish lazyness and desinterest from ADHD?  \\n2) Are there mood problems associeted with ADHD? And sensivity.   \\n3) How do you cope daydreaming?  \\n4) How do you start studying for a physics exam if deadlines do not motivate you? haha  \\n5) Are there screen problems associeted with ADHD? Can them be the reason or they are just something like a side-effect?\\n\\nAlso, if there are some interesting reading about the ADHD brain, I will like it. Even if I do not have this, it\\'s interesting to know :)',\n",

I don't know how much of this is actually due to ADD, since I also struggled with other mental health issues and bullying throughout my teenage years, which have had a ripple effect. But I know that it's not uncommon for people with ADHD to struggle with other things such as depression, so I thought it's still relevant here...\\n\\nI'm 27F with no degree in anything beyond high school/secondary education (I'm from Europe) and I have no driving licence, despite two years of driving lessons and multiple driving teachers (I didn't even get close to doing the exam). When I graduated from high school, I got the lowest grades anyone in my family has had. Both my parents have master's degrees and my sister who is younger than me is on her way to a second bachelor's degree. I'm literally surrounded by people who have achieved more than me. I feel incredibly under-accomplished; I know I'm not dumb, I have knowledge of quite a few subjects and am interested in a lot of complex stuff. I also read a lot and I'm almost always drawn to people who are a lot more educated than me (in terms of formal education). I just feel so marginalised and with the pandemic it's really hit me how much it sucks not to be able to drive. I can't even imagine what the freedom of having a car must feel like. I feel like I throw pity parties all the time and I don't want to turn into a negative person (probably too late, but I want to revert it).\\n\\nI have a child and am expecting another and I feel parenting is something I'm actually good at. But that's also a reason that I can't just give education another go. I've also been able to do some freelance work over the years and thankfully my qualifications never matter to people when I do self-employed work, but it's led to a lot of impostor syndrome and I'm literally insecure about everything (I've never had an employer). It also doesn't bring in as much as it should because I'm so slow and meticulous. If I had a choice, it's not the kind of work I would choose to do in life.

I feel like I'm confronted with what I would have liked to achieve, but haven't, on a daily basis. I really don't know how to cope mentally.

I revolve from knowing and angry about my circumstances, to I have no idea what's going on and I believe all my mother's lies, in fact I believe everyone who's hurt me in my life and I feel nothing, but I do want to die.  \\n\\nWell if I look at the stone cold facts I do not see why I would want to continue to live.  Right now I am regressing into who I was when I couldn't figure out what was wrong was my mom.  I believed her and acted as she wanted me to.  I was molested at 12, and began to develop schizophrenia.  I told her from 13 onwards, but she did get me a therapist but insisted on staying in sessions for years, I remember none of these years.  She ignored all the things I said, until I ran away at maybe 16 (she would do things like blame me for my sister leaving, that I didn't do enough to make her stay, straining her marriage, to a man who would use steel toe boots to kick my dog, sometimes down the stairs, and lock her away until she shit and pissed herself then beat her, but then it was my fault.  She would threaten to kill the dog and then scream at me for crying, and tell me it was my fault she would kill the dog bc I didn't walk her enough, when I moved I asked for a blanket since I had no room I just stayed in the basement with my computer nothing else, she gave me a blanket filled with old dog vomit), at the behest of my biological father, who then informed me when I was found that were he there he would beat me senseless, despite being the one to tell me to run (when I was molested he punished me by cutting me off from the family for two weeks.  My mother was only upset I'd told anyone.  Lied about getting a restraining order and didn't pursue the case).  Ten days later of staying with a friend mother tricked me and lied to the hospital that I was suicidal, tricked me into going there.\\n\\nI witnessed children nearly murdered by negligence, an poor 8 year old boy injected with a full dose of tranquilizer for a tantrum, resulting in a grand mal seizure they did not get him medical attention for.  My friend in there, jammed a sharpened comb so deep in her thigh there was blood everywhere.  All I remember of her was the butterfly she drew in front of me, maybe for me, and her screams down the hall and never seeing her again.  I tried to kill myself the first time after that, moved in with aunt, took dog, gave dog back to shelter and told them what my mom did so she could. Never legally adopt again.  Mom still tells me I killed HER dog.  \\n\\nMoved in with friend I ran away to.  Don't remember much, except psychosis getting worse and worse, terrified of boyfriend, left him from fear, he was the sweetest man I'd ever met in my life and loved me with his whole heart, but, he deserved someone better.  I remember the mom hitting me for fun, because everyone would laugh, because I am a retard they'd say.  Mom forced me to leave, but since I didn't move back home she held resentment.  Diagnosed schizophrenic now on disability, moved in with newish friend, she lies about her situation and I buy an apartment so she is safe.  Abuse abuse abuse.  Her stepfather rapes me.  She tells me it never happened and forces me to see him for months under threat of suicide.  I don't want to keep describing I'm done with that for now.  There's much more but I'm not going to keep writing because I am tired. \\n\\nI am recently mutilating myself quite severely under pretext I deserve to be raped, it is true I do.  Was an addict for a while.  Only help received, was being given harder drugs, and, shamed to the entire family.  No help for me.  \\n\\nNot treated by mother as person rather pet, because I am mentally disabled.  She vies for control every day, down to trying to force me to take six vitamins a day so she can spend money on them and tell the family how taxing it is to take care of me.  I need not one of them.  My sister's are people and she loves and is proud of them.  I have heard my mother say she is proud of me maybe twice, one was when she was shit faced.  I feel nothing and there is much more trauma I can't bother to tredge through.  I fully give up and have been sleeping through my entire days, now close to homelessness as my PTSD and schizophrenia are so debilitating I cannot work.  I am told this is because I am always pretending I'm the victim.  Yeah, I can't possibly have gone through so many things without deserving some of them.\\n\\nI'm tired, is it okay to sleep?  Is it okay to just sleep every day away like this, because I don't see the point being awake?  I've cleaned everything in perfect order there's nothing left for me to be awake for.\",\n",

Really, it was more than an obsession because, see, her friends also shared that same interest. She used what Manson put his followers through as a guide book. A documentary about the cult came on the tv, I hadn\\'t been paying much notice to what had been on before it. Well, it was on and it caught my eye because, being an adult, it should be easier for me to learn about the methods used to abuse me, right? Maybe I was being an idiot, I think I was, because all they had to do was describe one of the ways he warped their minds using acid, it brought a lot back real quick. \\n\\nThe question pops up a lot, in my own head more than it has been asked of me; why didn\\'t I go to my mother and tell her what was happening? Well, considering it was grooming and brainwashing to a child from ages [unknown]-6, I doubt anyone would even question much. Until I got older, I didn\\'t. After that, manipulation came easy to her and it didn\\'t take much to get me to do what she wanted. And I almost always would. I allowed things to happen to me even when I got older, until almost 17, just because I thought I had to. The mindgames, grooming, whatever, were very effective. There also happened to be the added bonus of my mom having mental illness and would often fall into rages. I loved her but was afraid of getting hurt because I was \"being evil\". Never told my dad either, that one\\'s easier to explain, he wasn\\'t hardly around. \\n\\nI remember her trying to convince me to run away with her. I didn\\'t want to go, I was a kid who never wanted to leave their mom like that, she left without me. Around that time, I think I got happier, getting sleep instead of being woke up nearly every night did me some good. Not feeling weird when I went to the bathroom (and in between) significantly lowered my stress throughout the day. I was a normal kid and it felt great. Then she came back for a bit, she\\'d found new drugs, and went back into her room down the hall. I was gonna be starting school for the first time soon and had been excited, I remember that. I also remember when she came and got me again. Things changed in the worst kinds of ways. It became more painful, more brutal and generally more sadistic. \\n\\nUsing drugs made it easier for her. Hell, maybe it became easier for me, too. I could numb out of pain sometimes, I\\'d be high off my ass and loving it until I had to puke. Looking back, a lot of what she gave me was what I\\'m almost sure was something opioid based. There were a few times, though, where it was a hallucinogenic substance and those times got scary. She convinced me she was wrestling with the demon in me because I had been possessed. She told me she was saving me. I\\'m a kid, I\\'m tripping on some shit, I believe her and allow myself to get hit when I focus on her. You see, I had to learn that she \"was my savior\" and we could never be separated because I\\'d die without her. \\n\\nWhy am I writing this here? I don\\'t know, this was meant to be a throwaway account. Maybe I just need to talk about it somewhere and to someone. There are things I can\\'t discuss with my gf since she also has PTSD from childhood trauma and this would probably set her off. I see my therapist tomorrow, so that\\'s something.

But the more time passes, the more I question if I\\'m just looking for an excuse to be lazy. I talked with my parents about ADHD once before, after they found out I\\'d been lurking on this sub for a while. They essentially said, \"you don\\'t have any mental disorders, stop looking at this stuff.\" Of course that\\'s absolute bullshit, because even if I don\\'t have ADHD, there\\'s something wrong with me for sure. I don\\'t believe them at all, but I\\'ve been tracking my habits, and what I\\'m thinking and doing and stuff.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI know this sub is very strict on what \"lazy\" actually means. From what I\\'ve seen here, it basically comes down to making the choice to do nothing, while ADHD is unable to do anything, despite wanting to. I feel like I rly do match a lot of the ADHD symptoms, but at the same time, I find myself choosing to be lazy. Actually I\\'m not even sure if I\\'m choosing, just that I\\'m not doing what I\\'m supposed to be doing. For the past 3 weeks, I\\'ve sat down to do work on my laptop, only to just watch videos on youtube. I\\'ve only done work for like 4 or 5 days out of the past few weeks. It\\'s absolutely crushing as I have so much homework to do, and half of it is overdue because I can\\'t just sit down and do it. Yet every time I do, I end up on youtube and I just watch a ton of videos until suddenly it\\'s 12 am and then I go to bed. I don\\'t stay up later because I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ll just sit there doing a whole lot of nothing and I function terribly the next day if I get less than 6 hours of sleep. I usually get 6-7 hours of sleep each night tho, which is enough for me.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe past few weeks have rly made me wonder if I\\'m just fooling myself with ADHD as an excuse to do these things. It\\'s that I want to. I make myself not play video games on the weekdays unless I finished my work. Only exception is Friday evenings because I tell myself that I have the weekend to do my work, and I need at least one day where I can relax guilt free and not stress about anything. Other than that tho, I\\'ve never played a game on a weekday ever since I enforced this rule on myself. But I\\'ve found myself on youtube instead of gaming. I\\'ve considered getting a site blocker for youtube but I\\'m not sure if that would even help, since I\\'ve literally stared at a wall for an hour before instead of doing my work. And that wasn\\'t a one time thing; it happened multiple times. Basically every time my parents took away my devices. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI have two friends with ADHD, both diagnosed before they were even 10, but only one of them is on meds rn. The other one is working to get on meds tho. I talked to them both quite a few times about ADHD and they both tell me that from what I\\'ve said, I have ADHD. But I feel like I\\'m only telling them stuff that makes it seem obvious I have ADHD. I guess it\\'s some sort of imposter syndrome, because I feel like I\\'m lying to people about the whole ADHD thing, despite everyone that I\\'ve talked to about it says I have it (except my parents). \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt\\'s very conflicting and it\\'s pretty much the only reason why I haven\\'t talked to my parents about it again. How am I supposed to convince my parents that I have ADHD when I can\\'t even convince myself? I have another post from a few months ago about my ADHD symptoms. If you\\'re curious about what symptoms I\\'m talking about, go check that one out. If you have a question I\\'ll answer that too.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nObviously I\\'m not looking for a diagnosis, but I do want to know if I\\'m justified in feeling the way I do, and how I can get my ass to work (aside from meds, that\\'s probably gonna take a while).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR: Feeling like a real piece of shit after getting next to no work done and having tons of missed assignments. Not sure if it\\'s executive dysfunction or pure laziness.',\n",

I was in a few relationships after I got diagnosed and they were all bad. It was either because the other person was a terrible pick or because I just couldn’t handle being close to people. I would assume the worst in everyone and was even hyper vigilant in my relationships. I assumed everyone wanted to battle with me. Thankfully I’ve gotten past that. No one needs that type of energy, it just exhausts you. But aside from my own actions, I also picked people based off of how little I could ask of them. I felt like I was too much.

I'm a 30-year-old male in the American Southeast. I am currently a believer in God, and always have been, to the best of my memory. I say, “to the best of my memory” because of that fleeting hint of doubt in the back of my mind which may have come from some possibly nonexistent time where I legitimately questioned it in a manner more than a fleeting thought. OCD is often called a condition of doubt: whether it's doubting your cleanliness, doubting your memory, doubting your intentions or doubt in the form of fear that something bad may happen if you don't do something in a specific way.\\n\\nWhatever the case, my experience thus far with OCD  has been all but a living nightmare, and I want to share it. This problem is still persisting, and I haven't attempted any therapy or religious counseling, for reasons I will include below. But let there be no mistake: this problem has stressed me nearly beyond belief, has interrupted my life to the point of near-exhaustion. It has gotten me strange looks from loved ones, and day by day, I wonder if it's ever going to end – if I'll ever be able to live a somewhat normal life. It causes me to feel condemned, sometimes, and that thought does frighten me, but sometimes I get so tired of dealing with it, until I just start ignoring it, almost like I'm giving in to it and accepting that I'm just an awful person. And I will be the first to admit...I am a wicked person, because I am an unrepentant sinner. I still try to do good in the world, here and there, but it doesn't mean I'm a good person. I may not qualify as an evil person in the eyes of society, but I would never say I'm a good person, because of my sins and the fact that I have been hesitant to commit to any faith because I have to be honest: I want to live my life in a way I choose. And there is a part of me that's fearful about saying that.\\n\\nAs I'm typing this, certain memories may come to mind about what I've dealt with, and I ask you to bear with me if it seems like some of the information is misplaced or scattered. I thought it would be easier to just write it as it comes, instead of trying to make sure everything is placed in relevant sections.\\n\\nAs I said, before, I've always been a believer in God, and to the best of my memory, I don't think there's ever been a time when I haven't. I grew up attending a Methodist church, on and off, but to make a long story short, I was never a member, and I left when my religious views and interpretations began to change. Suffice it to say, I now lean more toward Judaism than any form of Christianity. I don't practice Judaism, but in terms of what I believe, I'll tell you that I heard some convincing arguments against Christianity and in favor of Judaism.\\n\\nSo, I don't recall exactly when my issue started, but I suppose I should point out that I've struggled with this at least twice in the past. I suppose it began around 6 or so years ago. Let me describe exactly what I'm dealing with. Every day, I struggle with intrusive, blasphemous, insulting thoughts toward God. They are unnerving and trigger intense anxiety and apprehension, because of my fear of God's punishment. Sometimes, the thoughts are triggered by moments of agitation. Sometimes, they may be triggered by memories or situations which may be connected with previous occurrences of such thoughts. Or sometimes, they may seem to literally come out of nowhere. I have no desire for these thoughts; they are repulsive, upsetting and, very distressing. And each time they occur, I feel the need to pray for forgiveness, or else I may be punished.\\n\\nBut the fear of punishment doesn't stop with just me. I have feared, and still occasionally fear, punishment befalling my loved ones for my actions, be them family, significant others or even my pets.\\n\\nI've read numerous posts on the internet about scrupulosity and religious OCD, and I suppose there were at least a few very mild comforts to discover that some of the same things I feared have been feared by others who struggle with similar conditions. However, despite that, it never did anything to curb my fears, because in one way or another, there are often two mindsets at work against each other concerning these horrible thoughts. One says, “You're not alone. You know this is just a mental condition and the thoughts aren't what you mean or believe” while the other says, “Even if you don't intend to think these thoughts, even if that's somehow true, they're still in your mind, and you have done something to let them in, and you are responsible for them. So, you should pray for forgiveness to avoid being punished, or having someone else punished.”\\n\\nI'd like to describe a little about what typical days have been like, while this has been going on.Firstly, it's a struggle to even wake up in the morning, because it feels like literally as soon as I'm awake, the fear of having these blasphemous thoughts returns. And not long after that fear sets in, I end up experiencing these horrible thoughts. Sometimes, I can shake it for a little while, or shrug it off, but most of the time, I drop down on the floor and pray. Another thing I will mention is that whenever I pray, most of the time, I lay down face-first on my stomach, because I feel like I should be in the lowest possible position to express respect to God when asking His forgiveness for these thoughts, and some of them are truly awful.\\n\\nThese thoughts pop into my head all throughout the day. They feel like they're wearing me down. They pop in during conversations (including phone conversations), during eating, during shows, while driving, while shopping in a store – they could happen almost anywhere.\\n\\nWhen these thoughts happen, of course I pray for forgiveness. But it's difficult especially when I'm in public. Walking around in a store, having a thought occur, and then either having to find a bathroom so you can kneel down in prayer, or rounding the far end of an aisle, where no one's looking, so you can have a private moment to pray, it may sound crazy to you, but it happens. And while many would say praying is the compulsion in this (the “C” in OCD), I can't blame prayer for anything because I truly feel like I'm responsible for these thoughts.\\n\\nAnd whatever you're doing, whether it's shopping, talking about something, whatever, these thoughts are obviously very distracting and interrupting. I can tell you a frequent number of times I've gone “brb” while on long phone-calls and muted the microphone so that I could pray for forgiveness because of intrusive, blasphemous thoughts.\\n\\nWhile I would never say that a person can pray too much, sometimes, it feels very tiring to me, because when these blasphemous thoughts occur off and on throughout the whole day, I can find myself on the floor, many times a day, praying for forgiveness while distressed over whether or not your prayer will be heard, and trying to put your focus into the prayer and your feelings, so that God will believe I genuinely don't want these thoughts and want His forgiveness. And during prayer, sometimes, I will ask God to soften my heart, because sometimes (whether its due to the repetitiveness or something else, I don't know) I don't think I feel anywhere near as remorseful as I should. And so, I will try to make myself feel something...I will force myself to put some kind of emotion of begging into my words...and  I don't know if this is accurate, but it's the best way I know to say it in this moment...I will force myself to the point of near-crying to express to God my genuineness for wanting forgiveness and not wanting these evil thoughts. And this sometimes causes physical pain, even gagging. I know I must sound like a lunatic right about now...but this is the extent to which this issue is going.\\n\\nI would never blame the prayer, but I have to say that this is very tiring to me, psychologically and sometimes physically, too. My mother doesn't understand it; she doesn't know what to think of me, and I don't know a way to explain it to her in a way that would make sense.But often times, during prayer, the blasphemous thoughts occur during prayer, too. And let me tell you...it's bad. In the middle of trying to ask forgiveness for one or several thoughts, others come in during the prayer, and I have to stop, and ask forgiveness for them, before I can continue. And when I go to stand up, after the prayer is done...sometimes they come right back, and I feel the need to lower myself again, and pray again. This can happen two to four times during a single prayer session. And I just wish I didn't have to go through any of this...In fact, that particular issue got so bad that I would often find myself shouting out something or saying something random, out loud, once the prayer was done, to avoid my those horrid thoughts coming back into my mind.\\n\\nI've also used this throughout my daily life. Sometimes, when I feel a blasphemous thought coming on, or I feel that mental agitation starting, I will randomly blurt out things which have no relevance to a conversation I'm having or no relevance to whatever's going on. This has happened so often, kind of like a “safety mechanism” to divert my mind away from an evil thought, that it's become common and ordinary to me...Let that sink in...shouting out or saying random things in the middle of a conversation all to divert my mind away from hearing evil thoughts. My mother, and my romantic partner with whom I converse regularly over the phone, have both mentioned thinking I may have Tourette's because of it, because they don't understand the purpose of why it happens. I eventually did open up to my romantic partner, and she's been supportive. But I know it has to make her wonder about me...and my mother, I know, from her own confessions, she doesn't know what to think about me.These blasphemous thoughts also occur while I'm driving. And if there are other people in the car, I still pray for forgiveness, sometimes under my breath, but the same things happen as when I'm praying at home, alone in my bedroom. Other blasphemous thoughts come in, and I have to pause and ask forgiveness for those, too.\\n\\nMy fears around these thoughts are centered on the possibility that I, or my loved ones, may be punished. And as I said earlier, I have even feared for our cats. I don't know if this is a rational fear or not, and it doesn't help to be told by someone, “God won't punish your family for what you've done,” because how can anyone know what God will do? His ways are higher than our ways. Because I lean more toward Judaism, and live in a primarily-Christian community with no Synagogues around that I know of, I have not sought out religious counseling for this. I have opened up, just a little, to one of my Christian cousins, but I don't take his advice to heart because of doubts about offending God and because my faith and his faith differ.\\n\\nSo, I'm pretty much at a loss right now as far as what to do. I really wish I didn't have to deal with this problem. It is upsetting, very tiring, stressful and an absolute nightmare to have to deal with. It takes away from enjoyment of life. And at the end of the day, I suppose you could say that's what I want...to enjoy life, to live a comfortable and long life, and not be plagued by a problem like this.\\n\\nIf you've read the entirety of this post with good intentions, I want to say thank you. I'm not even sure if I'm asking for advice, so much as just wanting to share what's been going on with me. But if you have advice to give, I'll gladly read it, provided it's not attempting to change my faith or assaulting my faith in any way.\",\n",

In the spring of 2019, I developed an obsessive fear of raw vegetables and anything uncooked for fear of contamination. Not even washing fruits and vegetables throughly (sometimes for half an hour just standing at the sink, it was dreadful and embarrassing) would calm down my fears. That obsession has since calmed down (thank god), but since then, my other symptoms have progressed. I can’t touch anything someone else has touched without wanting to immediately wash my hands, I have fears of getting extremely rare diseases and infections. If I don’t wash my hands or clean something I feel is contaminated, I won’t stop thinking about it until I wash/clean to my satisfaction. I’m at the point of washing my hands 30+ times a day and often have to wash them in successions of 3, 4, etc. otherwise I don’t trust that they’re clean. I also have developed a repetitive sound sensitivity where if I hear anything such as snapping, tapping, or whistling for longer than five seconds, my head begins to feel hot and I begin to have severe anxiety until the sound ceases. I’m constantly filled with anxiety to the point where I grieve situations that haven’t even happened. There are so many other symptoms I’d be here forever typing them out. \\n\\nEvery time I’ve tried talking to my family about it, they just laugh at me. It all feels so incredibly exhausting and embarrassing. I feel like a complainer and I feel guilty thinking I’m too privileged to be able to even think about or worry about such things. I want to reach out for help from a psychiatrist or psychologist, but I’m scared they’re also going to invalidate me or just try to immediately prescribe me medication, which I’m not entirely comfortable with. It just all feels like a nightmare being stuck in my own head, worrying all the time. Any encouraging words would be wonderful.',\n",

She broke it off after some time over varying reasons as we still talk and I learn more about how she really felt and can firmly say I didn’t do anything wrong except this, she said I exhaust her. She initially said she felt indifferent to my feelings for her but I didn’t buy that and after recent convos it seems the bigger thing has been my pushing to communicate. Now everyone in my life knows I’m a talker (hell I’m a former media student who’s an actor now lol). I’ve talked and rambled about anything from nerdy shit, to politics, to life. I can speak and I’m damn good at it. But I can listen very well as well even tho after this girl I’m questioning that aspect. She said I lack emotional intelligence because as good as I can read her and people in general, I couldn’t read her being uncomfortable at times because of something I said. Or the confusing aspects of her telling me something serious but I interrupt it as a joke cuz most of the time she would down play the serious stuff in a cute funny way. But I think I’m side tracking LOL! The aspects I lack I’m down to work on for sure I get it. Dating these past two years has taught me a lot that I’m good at and plenty I’m not. I’ve pushed to stupid levels before and I’m fully accountable for my past and have made genuinely respectable efforts to improve. However before I find the right therapist to talk to, I wanted fellow ADHD folks opinion. Has anyone dealt with this issue? Of being so hyper and genuinely yourself that you’ve exhausted not only yourself at times, but friends, family, and even potential soulmates? Because it’s not just about her, but my entire life and everyone in it. Thanks I love this sub Reddit it’s helped plenty before and I hope this thread helps not just me but anyone who’s ever felt helpless. (I don’t want everyone to be tired of me nor do I wanna make them exhausted).',\n",

He means well, but it's the worst.\\n\\nSo basically, avoidance is my major coping mechanism for ADHD and it keeps getting worse. Any tips/advice on how to deal with this? on being able to confront things head on and actually get back on track, and convince myself that people don't hate me for not showing up to anything?\",\n",

              " {'sequence': 'I don\\'t really know how to phrase this, so I\\'ll try my best. I experienced trauma as a result of abuse in a marriage. My wife, after 5 years together, suddenly flipped one night after revealing she had started an affair. I\\'ve come to realize that she is deeply sick, and suffers from a personality disorder. But she was able to hide this very well for years, and appeared and acted mostly normal.\\n\\nIts been a year since I left her, and I\\'m finding that therapy isn\\'t really working. I\\'ve come to the realization that, essentially, my very perception of the entire relationship was wrong. But not really through any fault of my own: my wife was just very good at hiding herself. I did not expend a great effort deluding myself that it was healthy when it was clearly not: it seemed like a genuinely good relationship. I had generally firm boundaries, and I set realistic expectations, and voiced concerns as they arose. We spent many years happy together.\\n\\nSo I haven\\'t really \"learned\" anything from this experience. I\\'ve learned that I put my trust into the wrong person, that\\'s true. But also, that my very perception of who is and is not trustworthy, is not really reliable -- that it can be exploited and used against me too.\\n\\nI keep trying to find something that I could have done differently, some area where I could point to concretely and say \"this is where I made a mistake\" -- but I really can\\'t find one. Nothing major or unreasonable, that is.\\n\\nNothing I did in the relationship logically led to me being sexually assaulted, exploited, cheated on, and fearing for my life. Nothing I did warranted that reaction, so there\\'s really nothing about me that needs \"correcting\" or change, in that regard. Not anything that stands out as obvious.\\n\\nBut regardless, those things still happened, and now I just exist with the damage, and distrust. So now what am I supposed to do? How do you move forward, and convince yourself that human intimacy like that is a worthwhile endeavor, knowing just how horribly wrong things can go in an instant?\\n\\nI\\'ve been used and cheated on before, in past relationships and friendships. It hurts for a while, but you move on.\\n\\nNothing compares to what my wife did. I\\'ve never feared for my life like that, waking up in a cold sweat. I\\'ve never found someone on the kitchen floor, crying with a knife. I\\'ve never seen someone oscillate between screaming at me and calling me names, and then pouting and begging for intimacy. I\\'ve never had someone steal every last cent I had to my name, and accuse me of abusing them.\\n\\nAnd despite coming to terms and realizing that she was always this sick, and there\\'s nothing I could have done to help... what now? I\\'ve accepted that it wasn\\'t my fault, and nothing I did could have caused or prevented what happened.\\n\\nSo what now? None of that changes my current situation: no money in my bank account, traumatized, can\\'t hold a job, stuck living with my parents again, and physically deterioting health.\\n\\nNo one (at least those I talk to in person) seems to understand what I went through. Even my therapist, it feels like I\\'m just talking to a wall. And with the current state of the world, I can\\'t do in-person therapy, or EMDR, or anything useful.\\n\\nI don\\'t really see any viable path forward, and no one so far has offered any realistic opportunities for me, that actually account for my current abilities and needs. I\\'m horribly depressed, disillusioned with the world, and see no real hope, or anything to be hopeful for.\\n\\nAnd a part me doesn\\'t want hope. Hope for what, exactly? To love again? For success? Stability or happiness? None of that matters to me anymore. Nothing feels worthwhile.\\n\\n\"Keeping busy\" hasn\\'t really helped either. I\\'ve started over 100 different artistic projects over the last year, and they all failed to hold my interest. None of them are bad ideas, and all of them are worth pursuing. I just don\\'t care anymore. Nothing feels worthwhile, after having my whole life, future, and goals ripped out from under me.\\n\\nI didn\\'t ask for this trauma. All it\\'s helped me realize is just how chaotic, unfair, and unpredictable the world really is. You can do everything right, be kind and compassionate, loving, and still horribly fail, and be scarred and destroyed. I don\\'t really see any silver lining.',\n",

To start off: this is more airing out my experiences with panic attacks than venting about trauma, so I hope this can be an easy, non-triggering discussion for everyone!\\n\\nSo during Sunday, I was at a ski resort for snowboarding. I love extreme sports and was trying out my brand new board after it being waxed for the first time. I have a bit of a frailness to my physicality in that I need water frequently or I get nauseous because my gag reflex kicks in for some unknown reason, so by the end of my second run I was exhausted and trying to find a drink. \\n\\nAs expected, the reflex kicked in and I started feeling like I was going to vomit which I believe induced an anxiety attack (partially because the lodge was overcrowded and I couldn't remember where the vendor area was located, coupled with the fear of throwing up in front of everyone) and I have the nifty ability to faint during an attack. \\n\\nSo I was lugging myself up in stiff snow boots, up freezing stairs with no energy, and eventually my vision started to fade while I was struggling to breathe. I managed to calm myself down enough to grab a water and Gatorade, then trek down the stairs once more and toss my gear onto a table, then catch my breath and rest while re-hydrating. \\n\\nFor some reason I was mostly scared about attracting attention because I convinced myself that if I did faint, a medic would come and I would mention my epilepsy (not entirely sure how, maybe because I once mistook an attack for a seizure?) which would result in the situation escalating unnecessarily.\\n\\nTl;dr I nearly passed out at a snow lodge because I was tired in a very crowded space, yikes! I know that generally fainting is pretty rare for anxiety attacks but that was literally how my first attack went and I dismissed it as asthma, so the possibility of collapsing is more often than you'd expect and it makes me wonder how others cope with it in their everyday lives.\",\n",

I can divide cleanliness-related things I take issue with into three categories: \\n\\n1. Objectively ridiculous things that are no doubt caused by my OCD (feeling the need to wash my hands if I touch my leg, having a hard time with fridges because I feel like all the food inside of it contaminates each other). \\n\\n2. Matters of opinion where, while I usually lean towards the \"cleaner\" side, lots of rational people who don\\'t have OCD will agree with me (thinking it\\'s gross to fold clean tea towels on a bed that a dog sleeps on, not wanting to leave wet laundry in the washing machine overnight). \\n\\n3. Things that most people would agree are objectively unhygienic, which I\\'m simply more likely to notice/point out because my OCD makes me hyperaware (coughing/sneezing into your hands and then going about your day without washing them, wiping down the counter with the same rag you\\'ve just cleaned the trash can with without rinsing it out first). \\n\\nOn #1, I rarely if ever expect people to accomodate for me. I won\\'t ask other people to wash their hands after they\\'ve touched their leg. When I was struggling to the point where I couldn\\'t bring myself to even open a fridge, my mom offered to arrange for me to have my own mini fridge and I refused because I think that\\'s unreasonable. At most, I would (pre pandemic times) avoid handshakes even if it came off as rude. \\n\\nMy problem is that people who know I have OCD (mainly my family) act like #2 and #3 all fall under #1. They treat me like I\\'m incapable of having any rationality whatsoever when it comes to cleanliness. It briefly got better during the pandemic but I\\'ve gone from annoying and needlessly rude, to hero who taught us all how to cough into our elbow before the authorities were saying anything, to annoying and needlessly rude. If I ask someone to wash their hands after coughing into them now, I either get an eye roll and a death stare or I get straight up lied to (\"I coughed into my elbow/It was the other hand and I\\'m not touching anything with that\"). \\n\\nI feel like I\\'m constantly lied to the way people would lie to a child to calm an irrational fear. I am not a 3 year old in need of a water bottle labeled \"anti monster spray\". I\\'m an adult and I have eyes. You can say you disagree that something is unclean and that you\\'re gonna keep doing it your way. You can say you\\'re unwilling to change the way you do things but that I\\'m free to do things my way if I take issue with that. Neither of those would bother me as much as being lied to to my face does. But no, just lie about the way you\\'re doing things and then get offended if I stop trusting you.',\n",

I know it's part of his ADHD, and he tells me that when he experiences these emotions, there's nothing I can really do to make it even a little bit better. I've tried asking what I can do in such moments and he says that it's best to just say nothing and wait it out. However, that just feels counterintuitive and it makes me feel awful as well.

              " {'sequence': \"So I never considered that I had ADHD until the past year or so when multiple people have inferred that I do. I figure this is just because it's becoming more widely understood to be more than just little boys than can't sit still. I started to look into it and read about it and found that a lot of the symptoms do match up with my experience. I have a big ol' lack of object permanence (don't eat food in the fridge if it's in a drawer, leave clothes in the dryer for days, forget about clothes I have, forget to contact people I love), I'm just super forgetful in general (I have to write everything down or it gets forgotten), I always need additional stimulation / feels like I have a pretty consistent dopamine shortage (I eat for dopamine, I have to pair unstimulating activities with stimulating ones like eating or listening to music), I've historically been very very impulsive (spending money, making very regrettable choices), I have emotional outbursts where I just become very unreasonably angry, and I can never remember how I've felt in the past if it doesn't match how I feel currently. Also I have a history of heavy drinking and nicotine use / a very addictive personality.\\n\\nSo I decided to see about a diagnosis. I looked for specialists in my area and found one that takes my insurance. It took two months to get an appointment, but I finally did. He mostly asked me questions relating to the more traditional understanding of ADHD (Do I have a lot of excess energy? Did I struggle in school? My answers: No, I do not have a lot of excess energy. It kind of feels like the opposite. And I struggled in grade school because I did not find it stimulating, but I did well in college with the classes in my major because I did find them stimulating.) He ran cognitive tests on me and found that I scored pretty average on a lot of them, but very low in episodic memory. He says I likely have mild ADD, but that it doesn't seem to have affected me too terribly.\\n\\nHe prescribed me a two-week trial of Concerta, but he anticipates me not really needing it. We do not have another appointment scheduled--he said I can reach out to him to set another one up if I feel like the Concerta greatly improves things for me. Well it's day two, so I don't know if it's too soon to tell, but the last two days, I really have felt so much better. I don't feel like I need a break every hour during work, I feel like I can focus on things for a long time, I'm attentive to my job, I don't need extra stimulation via things like snacking. Yesterday I literally did everything I intended to--I did great at work, practiced drums, worked out, read a good bit... It was amazing. That never happens. I felt like I earned relaxation in the evening.\\n\\nSo what should I do? Should I make another appointment with him and try to get a long-term prescription? Are there any downsides to being on Concerta? Does it seem like he will brush off me wanting to get the prescription? What was this experience like for you / what advice do you have?\\n\\nTL;DR: It doesn't seem like the doctor I saw thinks I really need medication, but he gave me a trial prescription and I feel like it's really helping. What advice do you have?\",\n",

And since this farting this happened today, I won\\'t be able to buy the movie until I shower again otherwise it will taint the movie.\\n\\nThe issue I have with things getting tainted is that maybe next time I watch the movie or if the movie inspired me somehow, the thought about it being tainted and the farting thing will always be on mind when I think about the movie. In reality, I know it\\'s just the anxiety making me think this way. There have been things that were tainted (different ways) and I ended up forgetting it was tainted.\\n\\nThe solution to my problem is exposure therapy. But it\\'s so hard to do it on your own. I had OCD therapy a few years ago and we did these things. It worked very well. But I stopped taking my medications and stopped therapy because my ocd got stable. Unfortunately, my ocd came back early this year and it\\'s gotten worse. I started my medications a few weeks ago but the effects won\\'t kick in any time soon.\\n\\nCan anyone help me out? Maybe you have a similar story you\\'d like to share? This is something I\\'ve been dealing with recently and I just can\\'t avoid doing things because it\\'ll get tainted.

I asked him if it was possible that my anxiety comes from my ADHD and he said yes, but that he couldn’t evaluate me because the symptoms overlap too much. Without asking any of my symptoms, he also said that there was no possible way I had ADHD because I’m graduating from college in a semester and my schoolwork is probably difficult. \\n\\nI’m really upset because I think a lot of my symptoms are consistent with ADHD and I’ve been struggling a lot for a long time and it took a lot for me to finally make this appointment. \\n\\nIm wondering if anyone else has had this experience and if it actually is impossible to diagnose ADHD when someone has anxiety. I have to go out of network if I want to get a second opinion and want to make sure its a good idea before I spend the money.\\n\\nEdit: I have pretty bad anxiety but it’s not extreme and I’ve been working with a doctor for months now to find a medication that helps but haven’t had any luck yet making me think it is more of an ADHD thing instead of just an anxiety thing.',\n",

He has spent most of his life housebound, years restricted to one room, and even in his best years he could only really travel as far as the next town.\\n\\nThe list of compulsions he currently has is extensive, though I am less privy to what exactly his intrusive thoughts are. Think of any daily task and he probably has issues with it. It is a full time job for him. He refuses help now, after years in mental health units etc which he thinks didn’t help - but he was a lot better when he was getting that care. I recognise that he now really values his independence though even if his quality of life is extremely bad. I’m just scared he’s giving up. \\n\\nBefore the pandemic I was trying to visit fortnightly (I’m a 2 hour train journey away and don’t drive) to hold him accountable to his claim that he could do CBT by himself. We drew up some goals - to be able to move around the flat more freely, to use the toaster and microwave, and to be able to watch Star Trek without obsessing over the position of the tv (he doesn’t have this issue with other shows that are less precious to him). We identified some compulsions that he has lower levels of anxiety with to start with.\\n\\nUnfortunately due to the pandemic I was unable to see this through with him. He is even worse now.

First ever post on reddit so I apologize in advance for any formatting errors and general messiness.\\n\\nI was a very classic ADHD case: a loud, disruptive, hyperactive, impulsive boy with a low frustration tolerance and inability to pay attention. My parents put me through many different therapies and medications before finally agreeing to put me on stimulants. They helped... I think... but I was still a sad, lonely, and angry child. When I entered high school, my parents took me off stimulants and I didn\\'t argue because I didn\\'t even notice an effect. I spent 5 years off stimulants and I seemingly did well, earning mostly A\\'s and making a few friends. But on the inside I was deeply suffering. During my first year of high school I was suicidal and absolutely despised consciousness. I spent most of my time in my room on screens and had little to no life besides school. Life gradually got better (through therapy and natural development) and I\\'m now at a stable point in my life.\\n\\nHere\\'s the problem tho\\n\\nI DIDN\\'T REALIZE I WAS MENTALLY ILL\\n\\nEven with my diagnosis my parents never told that I had ADHD or expressed how difficult life can be with it. My dad even has ADHD but he didn\\'t warn me! I struggled for so long. I internalized all my ADHD symptoms, disguised as what I thought were personal short-comings. I was literally suicidal and extremely depressed but I normalized it because I though everyone felt this way!! I knew I was \"off\" but I didn\\'t really understand why. I learned what depression was back in 2018 and since I had most of the symptoms, I just assumed I was depressed. Even with my self-diagnosis of depression, I knew that there was something else wrong with me. Even though I knew I had ADHD (saw this written on my chart went I went to my doctor for a check-up), I didn\\'t think of it as an important or significantly life-altering disorder. \\n\\nBut it is. It abso-f\\\\*cking-lutely is.\\n\\nAbout 3 months ago after trying antidepressants (which had little effect), I decided to see my old psychiatrist and get back on adderall. And OMG what a difference!!! I was happier, more energetic, more hopeful, less depressed, and I actually had *desire* to do things! \\\\~*happy dance\\\\~*  The change wasn\\'t life-changing, but I feel like I understand myself a lot more now and I\\'m beginning to differentiate my ADHD symptoms with personal shortcomings. I realize now that my habits of interrupting people, lack of motivation, difficulty in eating attention when others are talking, fidgeting, losing everything, chronic tardiness, hyper focusing etc. are all caused by ADHD and *aren\\'t* personal shortcomings.\\n\\nSide note: I feel like I\\'m still downplaying my ADHD tho. I haven\\'t seen another person on this sub that has actually gotten **more** energy from stimulants. Also, I still fidget and I haven\\'t gotten any increased executive functioning, I just feel much better. These symptoms seem more similar to someone who doesn\\'t have ADHD. Does anyone else experience this? Do I even still have ADHD? \\n\\nAnyway, I\\'d like to thank all the amazing ADHD-ers out there on this sub! The reason I reached out to my psychiatrist was partially because I very specifically related to many of the stories and symptoms shared here. Seeing how others were struggling helped me realize how much I was struggling too. I\\'m very glad this resource exists :)\\n\\nThanks for listening and I hope you all have a wonderful day! (or night)\\n\\nTL;DR - basically the title. Never downplay a diagnosis and seek help if you need it!',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'I have struggled with what I assume to be False Memory OCD for about 10 years now... I\\'m a 33 y/o female. I\\'ve gone to a couple of therapists, one a specialist who was the first to ever recognize the sub-type of OCD I was likely dealing with. \\n\\nMy flare ups happen when I\\'m in a relationship, and I will have this sudden thought/fear that I was sexually innapropriate with someone (perhaps someone I was working with, had been around). Eventually a scenario will pop into my head, or I\\'ll \\\\*create\\\\* a scenario, and mentally check/compulse for HOURS and MONTHS to see if these things really happened. I\\'ll go back and forth thinking these things happened and didn\\'t happen. They end up feeling very real, and I can never decipher \\'deep down\\' if they truly happened or not. It\\'s just this cycle of \"Review, Review, Review, eh maybe this didn\\'t happen, Review, Review, Oh GOD I think this happened....did this really happen? Do I really think this happened? Oh god I did...I need to figure this out some more...\"\\n\\nI\\'ve had many scenarios in the past where I\\'ve eventally gone to the person I thought I may have done something innapropriate with, and they reassured me it was all in my head. And then at one point I had one where I mostly convinved myself I sexually abused my boyfriends child....I became suicidal. \\n\\nFast forward to now, I\\'m in a new relationship of about 8 months with EASILY the love of my life... In the past 4 months I\\'ve had two instances where I had thoughts/fears \\'latch\\' on: 1) I became convinced I was sexually innapropriate with a friend and 2) months later another where I got it in my head I slept with my boyfriend\\'s best friend when he visited us for a night. In particular with that last one, at the end I became pretty damn convinced I snuck up into the loft and slept with him. I get these thoughts and scenarios in my head, then mentally review and imagine those scenarios to see if they happend. Particularly with the second one, I become pretty damn convinved I did it....a certain image will really \\'stick\\' and it\\'s like omg shit...I think that happened! But I eventually checked with both people, who both reassured me I had done NOTHING by any stretch of the imagination. \\n\\nJust as I was starting to accept maybe this was all just my OCD, I had a fear/thought latch on that I was sexually innapropriate with my boyfriend\\'s 3 year old nephew the last time the three of us went out and I was alone with him...about a few months ago in the spring. Initially I was like oh shit...not THIS scary stuff again...I\\'m just going to ignore it. I\\'ve seen him multiple times since then, even this last weekend...SURELY if I had done this stuff it would have been in my conscious before and I would KNOW.\"\\n\\nWell, now I have a scenario in my head that I kinda think happened...it feels like it did when I imagine it and do those mental reviewing/compulsions. And I\\'m torn up over it...it makes me want to throw up and just...die. It\\'s horrifing. I spend all my time memory reviewing....\" Did I do this? Lets imagine it and see...oh my god I think I did this! Did I really?? No, this has JUST got to be your OCD bullshit....but then why am I thinking this happened when I imagine it?! I would KNOW if I had done this...do I know? Am I just not admitting it to myself because I am scared?\" And the cycle of fear continues. I don\\'t even have a deep gut belief that it DIDN\\'T happen....just like, \"I would HATE myself if I had done this. I don\\'t want this to be true, it\\'s HORRIFIC!\" So I just spend my time in complete fear and depression, and then I\\'ll get pissed and be like \"NO. It\\'s your OCD. It pretty much fits your patterns, so if it walks and quacks like an OCD duck...it\\'s OCD! And you KNOW you cannot trust your mind to \\'figure out\\' if you truly did these things or not.\" Which gives me peace b/c then I don\\'t have to believe my thoughts when I think these things happened....but then I feel like I\\'m just in denial and using that as an excuse to not have to deal with the ramifications of having done this shit. And around we go. \\n\\nIf I look at my patterns of OCD over the past 10 years, it certainly fits my pattern...but this last one I pretty automatically got into the headspace of \"omg I think I did this!\" when I imagine the scenario and mentally review. And it\\'s just like....WTF, I would never want to do this! The first time I thought I hurt a kid it mortified me and I wanted to die! And here it is again and I\\'m terrified and wouldn\\'t want to live b/c I\\'m a terrible person. \\n\\nYesterday I decided to call my doctor and try Clomipramine....I\\'ve always gone unmedicated b/c I\\'m afraid of anti-depressent side effects. I\\'m also going to get help from a NOCD therapist. \\n\\nI\\'ve told my boyfriend all of these things and he is SUPER supportive and loving, for which I\\'m grateful. I\\'m just really scared. He told me IF something did happen with his nephew, we would get me help b/c obviously I\\'m not that type of person and I self- shame and self-flagellate way more than anyone who ACTUALLY does these things would. \\n\\nI just...wouldn\\'t want to live if I did this disgusting thing to a child. I\\'m just so afraid I\\'m thinking it happened b/c it did happen....but then another part of my brain is like you KNOW this shit pretty much follows your OCD patterns and latched onto you like OCD does. It\\'s OCD brain, and you CANNOT trust your thoughts. So take the leap of faith it is OCD... I\\'m just also afraid that it\\'s real....if it is, there is no way my boyfriend should be with me. He wants to eventually get married and I couldn\\'t do that to him....to his nephew...to their family...I would hate myself for forever and just live my life in solitude b/c I\\'m no good for this world or for anybody, and ruined my relationship with the love of my life.\\n\\nNot sure why I\\'m posting this on reddit....I guess hearing other people\\'s struggles makes me feel less alone. It\\'s isolating in my own head.',\n",

I was at a support meeting with three men and I became really engaged in the topic. I started making empathic, embodied, and affirming, passionate sounds while saying “yes,” “mmm,” and “‘mmmhmm.” At one point I said mmm and maybe it sounded like a moan or something because one of the men looked up and kinda looked aroused. During the meeting, one of the men lustfully stared at me which I shut down by turning by body away from him. He looked mad and sad during the rest of the meeting and ignored me. And then when we left the meeting two of the men checked out my body parts and seemed to have crushes on me. I haven’t been to a support meeting since and avoided them.\\n\\nI feel guilt and shame (which I know I shouldn’t) like I brought on the sexualization because my passionate nature may have aroused them.

I knew that some choices I’d made to take back my son’s dad were how he got access to me to commit the rape (I’m not blaming myself, I just know I took him back many times and would do it again even after he did this if I didn’t get away).

So I left, spent 10 months away getting help and called my kids every day, sending them letters or postcards every week and a care package every month.\\n\\nI came back to be the mom they deserved, but by that time there was an easy “she just up and left her kids” narrative. I’d called the cops on him and even filed a restraining order before (which was granted only because he admitted to punching a door… not because of anything I reported him doing to me). So after realizing he raped me I didn’t bother calling the police or pressing charges. I also knew that the situation would be made worse if I pushed too hard for more parenting time. I also couldn’t tell the kids why I left; I put the blame on me and said “I was sick and needed help so I could be a better mom to you.

              " {'sequence': '\\nRecently I started a new job and it’s really, really fucking me up. I struggle really hard to learn the basics of anything, and especially a whole new job, but I was somehow lucky enough to be kept on after a trial period when a lot of new starts with me got let go, because I managed to fit in well with my coworkers and ‘seemed’ to be learning well. I managed to fake knowing what I was doing with a smile, friendliness and a good attitude. But in the last couple of weeks as the training wheels have come off management have had to have 2 separate sit downs with me about my performance. One time it was cause I left something in an oven for like an hour after getting distracted and doing a whole other task that wasn’t as important and expecting someone else to get it, which was bad enough, I literally could have caused a fire from how fucking careless I am. Big fuck up. So, I thought to myself that I need to give this 100% and really try my very best from here on out. I’ve been stressed in work since then trying to really get every little detail perfect.\\n\\nThe mental effort doesn’t matter. Because after today’s shift 2 managers sat me down privately and told me my performance wasn’t good enough today. It was humiliating. I was focusing on tasks that didn’t need done urgently and forgetting basic shit I needed to be doing (story of my fucking life), making my coworkers have to pick up the slack who were visibly annoyed, and the thing is if they hadn’t sat me down I’d have just assumed I was doing okay and that my coworkers had some issue with me. It’s so embarrassing that they probably all realise the ways I’m fucking up while I’m oblivious to it, I never even knew how badly I was fucking up. They’ve been really kind and patient with me, and so have management, but I think the only reason I currently am getting a pass is because they seem to like me a lot as a person and want to see me turn it around.\\n\\nAnd I’m scared I can’t. The only thing that could probably help is fixing the underlying issue; getting help for the ADHD that’s probably hung over my entire life, but I haven’t even started pursuing that because, guess what, it’s too daunting and I do everything I can to put it off. One of the managers who sat in on that meeting stopped me privately and asked me one on one about half an hour later if I was okay after that meeting, in the most genuine way. That for some reason hurt the most. This manager, she is a complete and utter hardass, she gets pretty pissed when little things go wrong, but I think she likes me as a person too and genuinely wants to see me do well, and wanted to make sure I was alright and not taking it all to heart. She tried to reassure me it will click eventually, that it was a hard day too and that it happens, but coming from her who’s hard on basically everyone it felt somehow scarier. It was like she’s went beyond the usual tactics she’d use with people and has no idea how else to help me, or that I’m so pathetic at this that she has no choice but to feel sorry for me.\\n\\nAnd I fucking am taking it to heart. I hate myself for being like this. I told her it was fine, that they have a job to do and it’s not their fault if I’m not performing, and it’s me that needs to do better, but she honestly just looked kind of sad for me lmfao. I think I sounded like an emotional wreck when they sat me down cause I honestly just wanted to cry. I hid it behind self-deprecating jokes and apologising and asking how I can do better, like I always seem to do in work and life in general. It never changes. Here I am, the guy who was told growing up I was so talented, so smart, I could be anything I wanted to be, I had such a bright future ahead of me, and I can’t even grasp anything I put my mind to. Being an adult is just fucking overwhelming and it feels like I’m trying, truly trying so fucking hard, and even if I try twice as hard I can’t reach what a ‘normal’ person can with half the effort. I think people can tell I put the effort in but just wonder what the fuck is wrong with me, and it’s so much worse letting people down constantly when they want you to do well.',\n",

It would be great if I could find something that provided this same benefit at night but without the head stimulation that would keep me awake!\\n\\nInterested to hear everyone's thoughts, thanks.\",\n",

If your school also sucks, please drop it in the comments. If your school rocks, drop it in the comments. I am school shopping if you can't tell.\\n\\nWhy you should not attend school at the University of Minnesota in the College of Science and Engineering if you have ADHD, a non exhaustive list (save yourself hundreds of thousands of dollars, yes even you in-state student):\\n\\n1) The process for receiving accommodations is ableist against those of us who have ADHD.\\n\\na) The school has an official policy against retroactive accommodations: meaning that if you go to the school, and you think that you have ADHD at the beginning of the year, and it takes three months to get a diagnosis, you are fucked. If you forget to renew your accommodations, you are fucked.\\n\\nb) The way that accommodations works at the University of Minnesota, is that you have to do several meetings where you outline your challenges and put them on a letter of accommodations, which **you** then disclose to your professors to receive accommodations. This letter needs to be renewed every semester. It does not carry over through your academic career, yes, usually you can send your access consultant an email, saying, hey, please renew my accommodations for this semester, but you have to do that. You also have to meet with your professors about your accommodations. Which is both incredibly hard for those of us who have rejection-sensitive dysphoria, and also, an extra executive functioning task.\\n\\nb1) The process is professor driven and professor oriented, but Professors broadly aren't given any additional resources or training for disabled students. There also isn't a good accountability mechanism for professors who are ableist (or racist, or sexist, or really any kind of ist.) You can give your professor the letter, and your professor can just straight up tell you, no.\\n\\nb1a) The accountability mechanisms that do exist, EOAA, Student Conflict, are not accessible to us. Usually they involve meetings, and phone calls that need to be made via phone, as well as paperwork that has deadlines. Basically, more executive functioning tasks. More rejection sensitive dysphoria.\\n\\nb2) There are no curricular accommodations at the University of Minnesota, since a lot of us have multiple disabilities, this is a huge barrier. If there's a course that's just completely inaccessible to you, that's your cross to bear.\\n\\nc) There is only academic accommodations. Procedure and office accommodations basically do not exist. If you need accommodations in, say, the required semesterly meeting with your advisor, you're just fucked. If you need an alternative method of contacting an office that isn't a phone call, you're just fucked. If you need an alternative method of logging into your course portal, you're just fucked.\\n\\nc1) The school has required two-factor authentication for logging into course materials, and course materials automatically log you out weekly. *Have fun with that.*\\n\\nc1a) IT at the school in general is very dismissive of the needs of disabled students, and frequently makes big technology changes (like two factor authentication) without consulting disabled students.\\n\\n2) The student doctors office, Boynton Health, has an official policy of not diagnosing ADHD. Meaning that you must seek diagnosis in the greater Twin Cities, and pay a lot of money.\\n\\n2a) Boynton Health will charge you $25 if you miss a mental health appointment. Which is a pretty blatant ADHD tax.\\n\\n2b) Boynton Health only operates during the school day.\\n\\n2c) There are a lot of appointments that Boynton Health only schedules via phone call. These phone calls must be placed during the school day.\\n\\n3) The majority of classes in the College of Science and Engineering have a no late work for any reason policy.\\n\\n3a) *Sometimes* you can get accommodations for this.\\n\\n4) The majority of classes in the College of Science and Engineering do course planning on a daily basis rather than a semester or yearly basis.\\n\\n4a) Your syllabus is useless, you probably won't know when your exams are until a week before you take them\\n\\n4a1) Completely coincidentally, in order to schedule testing accommodations, you need to give the testing office the information about your exam a week in advanced. **You** have to. This is not done automatically. This is not done by the professor. **You** have to. You get one late-scheduled exam. This is another executive functioning task.\\n\\n4b) If you need document conversion, they also need your homework a week in advanced, but your homework is probably given out on a weekly basis, meaning your homework is guaranteed to be a week late based on the bureaucracy alone, which might not get accommodated, see above.\\n\\n5) The office of accommodations is mostly made up of liberal arts majors, liberal arts student workers.\\n\\n5a) Document conversion of textbooks is generally based largely on OCR, or on the textbook publishers metadata (which doesn't exist because engineering textbooks are written by engineers). You can have additional captioning done, but that is an executive functioning task, and also, do you really think that a liberal arts student can do an adequate job of captioning an electron band diagram? A bode plot? A circuit diagram? A Smith Chart? Or even calculus for that matter?\\n\\n6) There are almost no online course offerings in Undergraduate STEM\\n\\n6a) Even if there were, you wouldn't want them, unless Canvas being used as a glorified subversion server is your idea of a good time, which was basically the pandemic mood of the hour.\\n\\n7) Disabled students are regularly accused of academic dishonesty as a reason for not giving us course deadline extensions\\n\\n7a) Academic dishonesty is actually very common, and courses are heavily curved, how much do you want to gamble your tuition on your ability to do homework better than students copying the answers? You are already suspicious, your classmates, not so much.\\n\\n8) Professors in STEM hate disabled students\\n\\n8a) This is a research university, it's value is in your ability to do research. Your letter of accommodations can often act as a letter of blacklist from research opportunities, and letters of recommendation.\\n\\n8b) This is a research institution, which means the lectures are terrible and if you want to learn anything you're going to have to go to office hours. Quick question though, how much help are you going to get from a professor that hates you?\\n\\n9) All exams in STEM are timed\\n\\n9a) you can get testing accommodations, but it's just more time, it's not untimed.\\n\\n10) Most exams are not open book open notes, but require a notesheet.\\n\\n10a) Which is extra homework, extra executive functioning task, a rather important one.\\n\\nThere are more problems with this school's treatment of ADHD students, which you'll probably read about in the comments below.\",\n",

He has told me that as a religious person songs like LilNasx’s Montero Can trigger it.(as a gay person it’s a little upsetting but obviously that’s fine). What I’m worried about though, is two things. 1. The negative effects sexism against women has on men that make men’s mental health a taboo which makes me worried hes ashamed of his condition. Or 2. Although he’s religious and strongly believes in that stuff, he might have religious trauma from probable fear mongering in his church.

I used to listen to this song a lot until one day I saw some news about 🖤🕳️s that left me quite scared, I stopped listening to the song because of the lyrical similarities, luckily the news were proven false so I was calm and kept listening to the song, then another day, another news with the same subject came in and made me feel scared again so I stopped listening to the song again, again, luckily it was proven by experts that it wasn\\'t dangerous so I got calm again and came back to listen to them again, but this time a bit more careful of the song, this time I would stop it the last seconds before it ended completely, then finally another news came out which left me terrified but later they revealed it wasn\\'t dangerous again and that was the last straw for me. I haven\\'t heard the song in a very long time and I am afraid of doing it again, I have thought of deleting the song and even the other songs of the band from my Spotify, but I fear if I do that something worst could happen.

If I get caught up in thinking about what could be wrong for too long, I can literally feel a sensation form in my chest. The sensation feels like.. tension? or discomfort? It\\'s hard to describe precisely but it is basically as if the \"something is wrong\" feeling became embodied into a sensation, which sits like a ball in my chest and the stronger the sensation gets, the more I feel compelled to do \\\\*something\\\\* about it (never quite sure what to do since I don\\'t know the answer to the \"what\\'s wrong?\" question so I don\\'t know what to do to make the sensation go away, but the stronger it gets, the more desperate I get for it to be GONE.) My mind sometimes makes the \"something is wrong\" feeling relate to my OCD theme (ex: Brain tells me: \"you\\'re in denial about your thoughts bc you keep labeling them as OCD & they\\'re not. If you stopped being in denial and accepted the thoughts and did \\\\[compulsion\\\\], it\\'d get rid of the \"something is wrong\" feeling), but not always.\\n\\nI\\'ve searched this reddit (and google), and I came across \"not quite right OCD experiences\", which at first seemed applicable, but then the [article](https://ocdclinicbrisbane.com.au/oc-related-disorders/not-just-right-experiences/) I was reading made it seem like \"not quite right\" OCD deals with actual objects in one\\'s environment? Like for example: There\\'s a stapler sitting on the desk. OCD person gets an urge to move it into a different position because the stapler\\'s current position just \"isn\\'t quite right.\" (when the reality of it is, there\\'s no issue with the stapler\\'s initial position.)\\n\\nI can understand that version of \"not quite right\" ocd, but that version/explanation of it, is very different from what I am trying to explain. Mine is more so this general feeling that something, like in my life, is wrong, something is off. There\\'s nothing in my environment that sets it off or no physical object in my environment that I feel compelled to adjust, move, etc, so that has me thinking that the \"not quite right\" experiences are not to blame? Unless the article I read just gave very limited examples of how \"not quite right\" experiences can present themselves.\\n\\nCould this \"something is wrong\" (when nothing is wrong) feeling still be part of OCD? Does anyone else experience this or anything similar? \\n\\n\\\\[To make it clear: I do have OCD. I am trying to figure out if this experience I keep having is part of OCD, or if there\\'s something actually wrong in my life and I just can\\'t figure out what it is.\\\\]',\n",

Reading this reddit and doing internet tests, we are now pretty sure she has it, especially after she started having burnout. But she has not been diagnosed yet. She has, however, been diagnosed by psychologists and psychiatrists with depression, anxiety disorder and OCD.\\n\\nThis burnout is taking her pretty hard. She has sensory fatigue: too much or too little or changes in lightning upset her, she is having trouble with sounds (like running water, for example, or even the sound of mine and my mother's voice) - it's all too loud -, and with motion too (she is having trouble walking on busy streets because of the movement of the cars and she has not been able to watch TV or use a pc or mobile phone anymore).\\n\\nThis started around November; she seems to improve little by little (in the beginning she couldn't even listen to music or to her favorite series) but sometimes she gets worse suddenly. I don't know if it's because of the weather or because she didn't sleep well or... I don't know. These last couple of days she is saying she feels too fatigued even to eat and swallow, brush her teeth, etc.; she can do it, but she feels too tired to do anything else. She says all this makes her feel nauseated, which makes everything even more difficult to her.\\n\\nWhen she could, used to read a lot of your experiences here. I've also read some articles on the internet about autistic burnout, so we know the general advice. She knows she has to rest... a lot. But she has trouble sleeping sometimes, she has trouble sleeping during the day, and feels all the rest she gets is not enough.\\n\\nWe live together in a small apartment (us both and my mother) and have changed a lot of habits so she doesn't feel so bad... a lot of the things we do seem to really hurt her in a way I can't understand. It hurts so much to see her in pain like this, in the middle of a pandemic (here in Brazil things are pretty bad and we are afraid to go to the doctor, for example)...\\n\\nFor those who unfortunately had autistic burnout and too much fatigue, what did you guys do to get better? Tea, vitamins, habits... anything. We are at a loss and I don't know what to do :(\\n\\nThank you for reading this.\\n\\nTLDR;: My sister is going through autistic burnout and is having too much sensorial fatigue and fatigue in general. Sleep and rest seems to not be enough. What can I do to help her?\",\n",

              " {'sequence': 'TLDR: Made a [Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b9df40cfb4194b1eafbfcea4d78485c3) that calculates a “Start Time” for you ahead of something you need to have done on a specific date/time, with an option to add “prep time” as well, and then puts it in your Reminders. \\n\\nIt was borne of a need to track my many different dishes to prep ahead of a ETA (estimated Turkey arrival) of 4:30 pm on Thanksgiving. Input prep time (chopping, taking a shower, etc), input duration (bake time, drive time, etc), and the workflow adds an item to your Reminders to start the task with the padded time you added for prep and duration.\\n\\nThe workflow goes something like this:\\n\\nAsk: What’s coming up? (Text)\\\\\\nAsk: When is it due? (Date/time)\\\\\\nAsk: How long does it take to prep (in minutes)?\\\\\\nAsk: what’s the duration (in minutes)?\\\\\\nSubtract: duration + prep time from due date (Start Time)\\\\\\nAdd: (Text) task to Reminders with (Start Time) due date\\\\\\nNotification: “Time to start (Text) added to Reminders list with (Start Date) ( (prep time) )!”\\n\\nSometimes for prep time I just add an extra 10 minutes or so of “somehow always running late” time. If you don’t need it, use 0. \\n\\nI wanted the notification as a quick visual confirmation. And it was a debug, to make sure the times were adding up correctly. \\n\\nLimitations: this is my first shortcut, so it’s probable that it could be made more succinct. Also, the time input is in minutes, presuming you’re calculating start time to something you’re doing later today. Calculating minutes for something a week or month away could be cumbersome, and create room for error. There are probably ways to tailor &amp; correctly calculate a time input (such as 1:30 meaning 90 minutes) but I don’t know how, yet. You could just manually add a few days or months to it if the time of day was calculated correctly.\\n\\nAnyway I have already used it a couple times since thanksgiving…so it may help someone else!',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'I\\'ve struggled my whole life with \"Black & White Thinking\", as my therapist calls it. Basically no matter the situation, if *everything* doesn\\'t meet my exact expectations, it\\'s the worst thing that\\'s ever happened to me. Like, if I was hoping to grab a pizza, see a movie and then go to a bar, but the pizza place is closed- the whole night is fucked.\\n\\nThis line of thinking has gotten me into trouble throughout my whole life, but lately as an adult on meds it\\'s been taking a bigger toll than ever. As soon as something goes wrong at work or at home, I can\\'t focus on any of my other responsibilities until I fix the issue at hand. No matter how minor of a concern it is, I will put all of my newfound energy into resolving that problem until I succeed or burn out.\\n\\nA good example of how this messes me up is with appointments. If I have an appointment set for 1PM, every second before that time has to be put towards mentally preparing myself. So, nothing gets done for most of the day and then I\\'m left picking up the slack later on. It\\'s even worse if it\\'s a *really* important meeting, and I know about it in advance.\\n\\nI recently started my own business, and while it\\'s been going pretty well, I still have lots of anxieties about it. I\\'m broke and living with my parents, and this company is my ticket to freedom- so when something goes wrong, I *panic.* Needless to say, something went wrong pretty recently. So to try and resolve the problem, I proposed a meeting with the client for this week. \\n\\nSo: I have a set date for a meeting, which is intimidating enough in and of itself. But on top of that, the client never confirmed the date- so now I have to wonder about how much time I\\'ll have to prepare. And if we *do* have the meeting on the proposed date, I have to 100% prepare all my talking points and materials NOW. And while I\\'m dealing with all of this, my other work is slipping through the cracks and not getting done.\\n\\nNow I have this mysterious meeting coming up that could potentially dictate my quality of life for the next few months, and all I can do to make myself fell better about it is prepare, prepare, prepare. Even if I put entire days and nights into accounting for every possible outcome, something in my head still tells me that I need to prepare *MORE.*\\n\\nAll of this (coupled with my myriad of addictions and tendency to pump myself full of caffeine *on top of* my daily 50mg Vyvanse) causes my anxiety to go through the fucking roof. Seriously, sometimes it feels like I\\'m just gonna explode. Plus, that anxiety is distracting and leads to sloppy work on ALL fronts, including the problem at hand. I over-prepare to the point that I come full circle and screw myself by thinking about it too much.\\n\\nAnd this whole business thing is just one example, this shit affects me in almost every aspect of my life. Weight loss, finances, health, relationships... I never progress in any of them because I feel like there\\'s always this *one* thing keeping me from succeeding. And if I could *just do this ONE thing,* I would have the momentum to get myself to the finish line. But inevitably, that \"one\" thing is replaced by another thing, then another thing, then another- creating an endless loop of anxiety and a need to \"get ready\" for some ambiguous task in the future.\\n\\nI\\'m exhausted. I just want to live my life with a ***modicum*** of certainty, but at every turn there\\'s always an opportunity for something to go wrong. I *KNOW* I can\\'t plan for everything in life. I *KNOW* there will always be unforeseen factors at play. I *KNOW* the anxiety will continue regardless of any \"preparation\". But it doesn\\'t matter, something inside of me isn\\'t satisfied until I\\'m absolutely certain that all of my bases are covered.\\n\\nI don\\'t know if I expect anyone to get anything out of this post, I guess I\\'m just venting. If you managed to get this far, I guess you at least somewhat know what I\\'m talking about. Even if not, thanks for reading anyway :)',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'I’ve thought about this a lot (F35). I started school in the US in 6th grade but I lived in Mexico until I was 14- I lived in a border town so it was common to live in Mexico and cross the border to go to school or work in the US every day back then for many of us. I was always a good student, good grades, organized, responsible, motivated.. until I got to college. Just seemed like everything fell apart and my brain became scattered once the structure of grade school was gone. I failed classes and was even on academic probation my first year of college. I struggled with the reading because I couldn’t easily comprehend, and it took soooo much work to understand a lot of what I was reading- I majored in philosophy so a lot of the reading was very difficult for me. At one point I had a childrens dictionary and a Spanish-English translator dictionary, to try and help me understand. I still love school and I even miss it because I love learning, but it has been so difficult. I have a masters now and even then I always pulled all nighters to finish a paper, I turned in almost all my papers late, and short of the required pages. I couldn’t for the life of me to just sit and do my homework until it was due the next day. \\n\\nI’m a therapist now, and I absolutely love what I do, and I’m able to be present in sessions with my kids, but I do have to write things down or I will forget- especially if I tell them we’ll do a certain activity next session, or I tell them I’ll bring them a fidget toy, even sometimes when I tell them “I’ll check in with you later”- if I don’t write it down I’ll forget. And documentation? Man, I’ve been at this agency for almost 8 years and almost every year I’ve gotten talked to for being soooo behind. I’ve been micromanaged, I’ve been close to written up. My boss of bosses has had to sit with me so I can focus - kind of like a note party- to the point where I’m thinking almost every day, that I’m going to get fired. Or feeling high anxiety whenever I see one of my supervisors. It’s a very stressful way to live and I feel so helpless. \\n\\nI reached out to my therapist and psychiatrist about being evaluated for medication. My therapist mentioned ADHD manifests differently in women, mostly internalizing as opposed to the hyperactivity. She also mentioned sometimes it becomes noticeable until we lose structure which is typically around college. I met with my psychiatrist today and she pretty much made me feel dumb and somewhat ashamed about asking for an ADHD evaluation. She stated ADHD never ever ever ever ever ever ever (that’s exactly how she said it) manifests or comes up as adults, always noticed and diagnosed as children because we’re noticeably hyperactive/impulsive/have poor focus and concentration, get into trouble all the time- which was not my case. \\n\\nI do have a history of trauma, and I’m currently on medication for my impulsivity and mood dysregulation. But can’t help to wonder if there’s some sort of language barrier that keeps me from being able to concentrate and have good executive functioning. My psych prescribed me Strattera after all, and I really hope it works because my life has not been as enjoyable since there’s constantly guilt about not doing my job right, feeling lazy, ungrateful, irresponsible. \\n\\nSorry for the long post, I don’t even know where I was going with this I’m just desperate to find a solution.',\n",

After being sexually assaulted by a friend last year, I keep having nightmares from which I wake up screaming or get spooked by the smallest sudden noise or motion. Then there are the ones I’ve had since I was about 10, reliving watching my little sister bleed to death. At least it makes sense why I’d have those. What doesn’t make sense are the other nightmares about my parents. Growing up they were, well…I hesitate to say abusive, but very very strict at least. There were a lot of good times, but there was a lot that didn’t sit right with me: physically punishing the kids as young as 9 months, really harsh physical disciplines especially for the younger kids (we’d all had a spoon or hairbrush broken over us at some point), putting spyware on all our devices or doing things like reading our journals, severely limiting who we could be friends with and often taking the money we worked for or had been given for a birthday or something and use it for their own personal interests (this wasn’t a case of financial need by any means). My mom in particular terrified me; when she’d get mad she’d scream and swear and threaten and sometimes backhand us across the face. She got mad at me a lot. I journaled a lot as a coping mechanism, so there’s more I have written down somewhere, but honestly it feels like my brain blocked out a lot of what happened. That’s the part that doesn’t make sense. I’ve moved out and I’m living the life my parents never let me have  (if you’ve ever seen the documentary “Jesus Camp”, that was pretty much my childhood), but I still regularly have nightmares about my parents hunting me down, beating me, dragging me back, while no one around does anything to help. As parents go I feel like other people have had things a lot worse, which is why it’s weird that I’m still so terrified of my folks, especially since I’ve got plenty of other nightmare material and technically I’m safe now.

So through college I have been a bartender, started at 18 (the age in my state you can legally serve alcohol) and started working events. Mainly weddings and stuff. It was so busy and hectic that I almost never had to speak more than 6 words to anyone attending the events. Typically just “what would you like to drink?” Then boom, jack and coke hits the table and they are off. Well about a year ago they bumped me up to the “main bar” which is the fine dining bar which I really didn’t like the idea of because I know myself to be pretty awkward with chit chat. Well after months of struggling to be the charismatic bartender that most people assume bartenders are I realized that I’m actually reallyyyy bad with chit chat and became incredibly stressed and on edge both on the job and at home. Well, I started getting sharp chest pains and my wife pretty much forced me to see a doc. After all my tests came back inconclusive my doc pushed me to a therapist for stress coping. Turns out I am very much on the spectrum but my diagnosis of ADHD as a child sort of masked any ADS symptoms.

My family life is terrible and I have nothing in common with them. \\n\\nWhy did I turn out like this? Shouldn’t environment and genetics make you more similar? I’m more of the artistic type and they’re all more practical. They try to understand by talking to me about it but it just feels so unnatural, like they have to force themselves to do it. \\n\\nIm just a gangrenous limb to them. I think it would be better if I was dead. I have no hope for the future. I’m studying psychology in college right now which I thought would be useful but apparently you can’t do anything with that now unless you go to graduate school (I’m barely passing college, I don’t really do much work either). I wasted most of my life isolating myself from others because my self esteem is low and now I have so many wasted opportunities. \\n\\nI could’ve done a foreign exchange program, had a better relationship with my ex girlfriends, or even just said yes to people more often. But I didn’t. Now I’m gonna be 21 this week and all I can really summarize my life as is “repeated the same mistakes over and over.” \\n\\nPeople tell me I’m so many different things I don’t even know anymore. Am I Smart or stupid? Racist or a libtard? Depressed or borderline? Make up your minds. \\n\\nAnd finally, I really, really messed up. I can’t even describe it here because I don’t want to incriminate myself. I should say no one’s life is in danger, and there was no real victim, i didn’t directly hurt anyone, it was just a really bad decision that I did without thinking. There has been no legal action yet. I talked to my mom about it and she was disgusted with me. I ended up cutting and burning myself that night. \\n\\nMy mom got me a lawyer however, and the lawyer said that legal action for something like this isn’t always a guarantee but it’s still possible. Either way, I’m ashamed of myself. That event was the turning point. \\n\\nIf legal action happens my life would really be over, but then again it never even really started anyway. This isn’t just a misdemeanor, this could be felony level. My family is ashamed of me, I’m ashamed of me, and my life is basically just a series of repeating the same mistakes over, and over even though I know it’s wrong. I have a noose ready and everything. There’s really no point in continuing. I’m basically dead anyway. \\n\\nAnd I know the whole “but your family!” Well I’ve just caused them nothing but pain because they’ve had to take care of me while I’ve been depressed. Depression sucks the life out of everyone, including those around you, and I’m painfully aware of that fact. Yeah it would suck for them initially but wouldn’t they be better off in the long run because they’ve wouldn’t have to be around a sad piece of shit that brings them down? \\n\\nMy only hope lies with God, Jesus and the afterlife. No girls want to date me. No one wants to hire me. No one even wants to talk to me. My depression makes me physically ill. I get headaches from being so angry, I cry for no reason, and I can’t sleep even though it’s been 2 fucking days. God save me. \\n\\nI know I’ll probably go to hell especially after suicide but I think for the constant pain I’ve caused others would justify it. I see it as a mercy killing, like putting down a dying dog.',\n",

Recently, I have moved houses. In my old house I felt very restrained, unable to work or be productive, because of the environment. Things like how I had my bedroom set up, how I shared a (not so clean) bathroom, and the entire environment held me back from doing things like work on my computer and overall made me feel very unmotivated and overwhelmed, helpless, even. Since getting a whole new refresh with this new house it is almost like I have turned into a completely new person. Now I have the urge to clean every day and maintain my productive space and I overall feel very happy. But is this sudden switch into obsessive cleaning apart of my OCD? I do not experience any dooming thoughts if I do not clean. I just sort of get random desires to clean. For example, I just deep cleaned my entire bathroom for an hour at 2AM.

I eventually messaged loads of people for reassurance and they all came back and said I have done nothing wrong or they cannot remember or anything like that but that was still not enough, so I eventually gave up and remembered there has not been a time in the relationship where I have felt intense guilt or been secretive over my phone. Another compulsion for this was the fact I have never physically cheated, however now my rocd has latched onto that. My compulsion was that I went to Reading festival 2021, with two mates. My partner was obviously paranoid but I messaged her the whole time, and phoned her every night before I went to bed, sending videos of my tent etc, I litterally never came into contact with any girls, me and my friends all had partners, we all had no intention of cheating, I gained no new phone numbers, no social medias etc. I wouldn't even talk to other girls, only a few in casual conversation and would bring up my girlfriend and her dog if they basked or I was having an actual conversation.

This has been with me ALL my life. It\\'s fucked me up for so long. I can\\'t get over it. I\\'ve never addressed it. If a professional calls it invalid I\\'m going to lose it. I have an appointment with a psychologist soon but I feel so scared. It was terrifying to even talk to my  doctor about my trauma and the next week I spent having anxiety over the fact that he *knows. And he\\'s judging and writing it down and going to tell everybody and then use it against me.* Nobody knew so far except three of my friends, one of whom used it against me to mock me when they were mad at me. I don\\'t talk to them anymore.\\n\\nI\\'ve never spoken about it really. My trauma is hospital-related, especially the surgeries at the beginning of my life. I was born and then subjected to the most traumatic experience of my life which my brain isn\\'t even supposed to be able to memorize yet. Whenever I tried to talk about it my parents go \"everyone feels like that, nobody likes hospitals\". They always have. I felt so unheard which only made it worse and worse. I would cry and scream and think about running away every time I heard I had to go there. I would do anything not to have to go there. Honestly the last time I went there I also cried because they tried to put some breathing machine on me and I was afraid it was going to kill me. And I thought that was normal, because nobody likes hospitals. Everybody gets sick to their stomach thinking about them or seeing media related to them, right?\\n\\nEvery year I go to a hospital. Every YEAR I go to the one place that gives me trauma and every year that date is waiting for me. And I can\\'t even remember most of it. It fucking scares me. I\\'m so terrified of this place and everything about it and I don\\'t even remember anything bad. How am I supposed to process shit I don\\'t even remember? How can I be so traumatized of something that feels like it didn\\'t happen? I feel like I\\'m not allowed have PTSD since I don\\'t have flashbacks, but I do feel anxiety when I look at things that trigger me. The only \"flashback\" if you can call it that was when I used not be able to lie on my back because it made me feel like I was in a hospital and like the lights in my room seemed to suddenly become fluorescent bright  and I could smell the alcohol. Vodka in general reminds me of the hospital. I have nightmares that are mixes of hospital-related and the time in school when I used to get bullied. I\\'ve ALWAYS had those on and off. Some to points where I refused to sleep. Currently going through something like that too. My triggers are on and off too. Sometimes I can look at hospital things and go to the dentist and be fine (although there is ALWAYS an underlying feeling of discomfort, but other times I feel anxiety looking at a surgical mask. (Start of the pandemic was the WORST.) Or hearing the word hospital, doctor, the equipment, anything that could relate to it. And impostor syndrome is eating me alive with everything. \"See, you can handle wearing a mask today, so you don\\'t have traumas. You don\\'t have panic attacks at the things most of the time so you can\\'t have PTSD.\" Browsing subs and reading other stories is both comforting to know I\\'m not alone with my small, every day triggers, but also alienating because medical trauma doesn\\'t seem that common, and I\\'m constantly comparing which I really, really shouldn\\'t do.\\n\\nAs a kid I was also terrified of being sent into surgery randomly. That someone would just drive me to the hospital and force me without telling me. One time my dad was driving somewhere and not telling me and I was about having a panic attack. Turning 18 was a relief because it meant they couldn\\'t legally do that without my consent. It is why I longed to be 18 ALL my life. And even now I don\\'t feel 100% secure. If my health gives up on me I\\'m just going to die because I won\\'t admit myself to a hospital. And it\\'s going to. It\\'s like I\\'m waiting to go through the trauma again, and again, and again...\\n\\nI\\'m really looking for any help here. Sorry for the long post. Would also love to DM with some people and maybe make some friends who understand this, because none of my friends understand. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever spoken to anyone who does.',\n",

              " {'sequence': ' I want to explain my background in regards to gaming, and the \"issues\" I have when playing a tactical shooter like CSGO or Valorant.\\n\\n**Background**\\n\\n* I am diagnosed with Anxiety-Based ADHD.\\n* **Anxiety Issues** \\\\- I remember as a kid (before I knew I had ADHD, and I didn\\'t take any medication), I had lots of anxiety playing games like CS 1.6, though it would bring me lots of pleasure doing well in the game. Often times, if I was the last person alive, I would kill myself, to alleviate the stress of having to try and \"clutch\" the game. (People would interpret that as griefing, but my anxiety was so high, I just didn\\'t want to try.)\\n* **Current Medication** \\\\- I am currently taking Adderall XR (I just switched from regular Adderall.) This significantly helps me with gameplay. (Though I believe regular Adderall helps me more.)\\n* **Me without Medication** \\\\- Without any medication, I have a hard time staring at a computer monitor, especially playing games. I can \"see things,\" but it\\'s hard for me to focus on the crosshair, and aim at things. Like it would take me extra time to \"visually process\" an enemy on the screen. <- I don\\'t know if there\\'s a scientific explanation for this, or how it\\'s related to my ADHD, but it just is.\\n* In addition to the previous statement, I find it easier to read information off of paper, rather than on a screen. (I.e. I would print out PDF files for classes, rather than trying to save money and read the info off a monitor.)\\n\\n**Current FPS Gaming Problem (Valorant)**\\n\\n* **Issues Focusing on Micro & Macro** \\\\- I realized it\\'s hard for me to focus on both the macro & micro things that are going on in the game. i.e. Either I am totally zoned in with aiming and having me hit shots, or if I have to look at the mini-map, and try to understand where the enemy is going, and rotating, I can\\'t aim as well. I can\\'t be 100% zoned-in with shooting accurately, while understanding what\\'s going on. Basically I feel like I get tunnel vision, and I can\\'t switch between the 2 modes easily.\\n* **Doing my Role as a Valorant Controller** \\\\- When I play a character who has to \"smoke the site\" (i.e. Controller characters like Brimstone or Omen), I have a very hard time on defense, because I want to help the other bomb site, and smoke it if necessary. So I\\'m trying to focus on both micro and macro at the same time. And I tend to not shoot well, and defend my own site because of this. Additionally, I often take-up the role of In-Game-Leader (IGL), because nobody else will do it. I know that coordinating with my team, and telling them what to do often yields a better chance of winning. Most of the time, nobody else will do it, so I step up to do it. This often leads me to worry about multiple things, like what my teammates are doing, in addition to trying to focus on shooting what\\'s in-front of me. I know this often degrades my own ability to play well.\\n* **Rare Instances of Playing Very Well** \\\\- I have experienced times of euphoria, where I enter \"flow state,\" and I am shooting like a \"God\". That has happened because of some environmental changes, such as upgrading to a lighter mouse, or using a new skin, where I can shoot very well. These \"changes\", has only helped me do well in short bursts (maybe a day or 2), before I\\'ve adapted to the changes, and I end up shooting poorly again. My guess is that the new \"stimulation\" of the environment changes somehow allows me to play better.\\n* **Knowing What Works for Me** \\\\- When I played in an informal team setting; I did much better, because there was an In-Game-Leader (IGL), who was able to tell me where to go, and when to rotate. I didn\\'t have to focus on the mini-map as much, and I felt much more free. I loved that sensation, and I wished I could always have an IGL who could guide me, and I could just obey orders, and focus on just aiming more.\\n\\nI was wondering if anybody could relate to my experiences, and if they have any advice on how I could navigate my shortcomings to play better.',\n",

I was predisposed to having it when I was born, and it probably got triggered when my dad died at 3.5yo. I remember my mom saying, \"Stop doing that with your eyes!\" once when she was talking to me (at 5yo), because I was doing a ritual and she didn\\'t understand why I was moving my eyes back and forth. So anyway...\\n\\nI have a touch of germophobia, checking, lots of intrusive thoughts, rumination, anxiety; a touch of everything, it seems. But the most dominant theme(?) I have is making patterns.\\n\\nI make patterns out of literally anything and everything. I draw lines in the air with my eyes, connecting random (but soon to be important) points, and have to retrace the line exactly a 2nd time. If I fail, a pattern starts. I have to \"undo\" the 2nd time before I can go back and \"undo\" the 1st time. That usually doesn\\'t work out, because it\\'s difficult to retrace *exactly*, so I do things differently a 3rd, 4th, etc time, and get into a very complicated \"game\" of remembering what I did the previous time, and working backward to undo it, until I undo the 1st line I drew. This rarely happens and just have to stop after I get to a point to where it\\'s just too complicated. It gets much worse than just looking around though. \\n\\nIt can and does involve every part of me. Setting my hand down and noticing the pressure and temperature on my fingertips and whatever other skin is making contact with a surface; what color and texture I\\'m looking at. Was I blinking? Breathing in or out? How full were my lungs? Was I (God forbid) swallowing at the time? If so, I have to repeat every single factor the exact same way, or I add another layer to the pattern to undo. It is *exhausting* and pervasive. A bit maddening as well.\\n\\nWhat really sucks is that it is ***so*** natural to me. I don\\'t even notice I\\'m doing it. If I don\\'t notice I\\'m doing it, how do I stop it? It\\'s been the way I think since I was 4! I\\'m pretty lucky to be a person who can (mostly) hide my rituals, but at the same time I wish people could see how bad it is. If I had to turn the lights on and off a certain # of times, I would notice and maybe be able to stop myself, but it isn\\'t like that. I\\'m glad no one would watch me doing that and make fun of me or put me down, but I also have nobody seeing how much I\\'m suffering and how awful it is. I really am trapped in my head. My mind being a prison is very accurate! \\n\\nI actually *have* stopped myself plenty of times, but if I\\'m doing it literally every waking moment, the number of times I stop myself in a day is insignificant. I don\\'t know how to change thought patterns I\\'ve had since I was a toddler.\\n\\nI met 1 person (in actual real life - not the internet!) who had the same type. After reading and searching this sub, it seems like a one in a billion chance that I met that guy. \\n\\n**One more thing,** and this seems kind of important, but all the people I\\'ve read about talk about how they think something bad will happen (to whomever) if they don\\'t do their rituals. I don\\'t have that, but instead I just get **the sensation** that something bad will happen. That overwhelming sense of dread you get, but nothing specific happening to anyone or anything.

Raping me, beating me up, choking me, making me watch her beat up the othe girl she abused with me until she was unconscious and even past then, triggering me, cutting me.. At some point I realized they’d never believe me and it’d cause me less pain to just shut up. I still kinda feel like they’re right and I did deserve it, and that I am being over dramatic.

I have been getting by unproductive and scatterbrained for years and years and i’m 27 now. Couldn’t finish college. Bullshit my way through every job i’ve ever had. I’ve been working an office job since last year and am lucky if I can get an hour of work done a week. I don’t know why they don’t fire me. \\n\\nWhat is constantly hindering my life though is the fact that I can’t shop for ANYTHING, whether groceries, clothes, furniture, etc. For example, when I go into a grocery store for only a few items thinking i’ll be in and out, I end up spending 3 hours there and I don’t know how or why. It won’t even feel like 3 hours, feels more like 30 mins. But then I won’t have anything to show for those 3 hours because i’ll literally walk out with like 5 things. I can’t have people come with me to the grocery store because if they’re in the car, they’ll complain about me being in there for so long and then think i’m mental when I come back with barely anything. \\n\\nClothing is even worse. I will go to the mall or a department store or outlet or whatever and assume i’ll be in there an hour tops. I will then proceed to spend 7 hours there and half my whole day is gone. 7 hours of me hyperventilating, crying, pulling my hair out, sweating and wanting to give up. After all that time, you’d think i’d have purchased a good amount of things, but again, I literally walk out with what I can count on one hand. \\n\\nIt’s gotten to the point where I genuinely hate shopping and view it as torture. I won’t go grocery shopping and instead opt for fast food which I feel shit about. I won’t buy new clothed because of how overwhelming having to pick and choose a wardrobe is for me. I desperately need new clothes but I shut down when i’m presented with too many options and am unable to make decisions. It’s winter and I don’t even have jackets. I’m wearing the same shit from years ago that doesn’t even fit properly. I desperately need shoes but there are too many shoes to choose from and I have this problem where if i’m going to spend money it has to be the best/most popular. \\n\\nI moved into my apartment a year ago and still haven’t bought furniture because even after a year and hundreds of hours of online browsing, I still can’t make up my mind. \\n\\nToday I went to Target to get a new planner because I think it’ll somehow magically make me productive even though I buy one every year and hardly even look at it. But my mind is like “I just need a new pretty planner, then i’ll for sure focus and organize my life.” I left the store 3 hours later with a bra, LED lights, and an ugly dress that i’ll probably return if I can gather the will to do so. “I can probably find something better on Amazon.” Even though I spent 2 hours browsing on Amazon earlier today. \\n\\nI have 23 tabs open on my laptop right now, a mixture of clothing/makeup sites and work assignments that i’ve been putting off. I can’t do the work until I shop and I can’t shop because I can’t make up my mind. So I shut down completely and take a nap and then things just pile up which causes everything to feel that much more overwhelming which then causes me to go back to sleep to avoid it. Cycle never ends, naturally. \\n\\nI had a date a week ago but I canceled because I didn’t have anything to wear and my makeup is old and expired and my skin has been awful because I haven’t taken care of it because I am overwhelmed by the amount of skincare available and I can research for weeks and months and still not buy a damn serum of moisturizer. \\n\\nFuck. This was meant to be a short and to the point type of post. Of course nothing is quick and simple with me. I hate being me. I’m absolutely sick of myself.',\n",

When I was with my last partner a year ago I came to the conclusion that I was almost certain I had adhd after reading about the symptoms and peoples experiences online. Naturally I saw a doctor and tried to get a diagnosis, even managing to find psychiatrist that could diagnose adult adhd (which my gp was having trouble finding?). \\n\\nAt the appointment with the psychiatrist however, despite me preparing a massive list of things to go through like I anticipated, we had a 10 minute or less conversation about my childhood and I was simply told I had depression and that was it. I didn’t even get to mention any of the non depression symptoms I had. \\n\\nSo after that I gave up trying to get a diagnosis. Worth mentioning that I was on antidepressants for quite a while and even managed to be prescribed very strong doses because they weren’t working to fix my issues (mainly to do with motivation).I stopped taking them several months ago however and I’ve realised they essentially did nothing-  I wasnt depressed.\\n\\nSo in essence I’ve started feeling a bit hopeful at trying again and getting a diagnosis since I’m even more sure now that I have it since the plethora of adhd issues still plague me without depression.\\n\\nSorry for the info dump. I was just hoping you guys might have some advice for me to rekindle my motivation to actually see a psychiatrist that will hear me out properly this time.',\n",

The crime I committed was dropped as it was only an argument that was later sorted. But it scared my so much being in the that the first time I slept I work up scared thinking i was in that cell again or that I was gonna get arrested. I don't know what to do or how to help with my anxiety anymore as I have no family no mum no dad nobody. And the only friend I have that I can talk to have been cut off from me by the people that think that are helping me, but it's not it's making more lonely and scared almost like I've been trapped in that small cell again. Normally in situations that stress me out I go to my close friend that I play with in xbox as they sadly are the only people I can talk to I put my worries on they have helped me more than people would ever understand and even since I got out of jail I have been treated like nothing I can describe they person I live with does help me out by putting a roof over my head but will constantly remind me of this as she always threatens to take it away from me and always makes me feel small. I pay her where I can if not I clean up after her, I admit I'm not the best in the world when It comes to helping but i try and i am only shown nothing but threats and warning. Since I got back home I came home to find my door taking off the hinges and told that the only people I can talk with to let me stress go, I am no longer able to talk to, she thinking shes helping but she doesn't realise if I cant talk to my friends I would have no one and the last time I literally had no one I tried putting a rope around my neck and would of done something stupid. The people around me that think they know what's best for me they dont, yes they have good advice but the way they try to force it in me like I'm a puppet makes me feel small and weak and I cant stand it. For me personally as a human being I know the basics thing I need to keep my mind away from dark thoughts. What the person I live with doesn't understand about me is that she thinks i play on my xbox and stuff to enjoy myself but that isnt the case. I wish what I'm about to say now i hope somebody could understand or relate, i play on my xbox because I have people that accept me for who I am and cheer me up when I'm feeling down, I have no one in my day to day life who is there for me but on my xbox I have people who care about me friends I've made for years. I've always felt so lonely but when I'm with those friends I can be happy. All I'm trying to say and I'm saying all this on here as I literally have no one else to tell this to is that I am struggling I have demons in my head and all around me, I am faced with the daily threats of being made homeless and the thought of being on my own. I am grateful if late from my friends who texted me and was worried about how I felt after getting out of jail, nobody but my friends asked if I was ok about the whole arrested thing and the answer is no it scares me a keep me awake and wakes me ever time I close my eyes.\\n\\n\\nI am sorry and grateful to anyone who has read all off this I know it's not clean and goes off subject alot but i just needed something like this to happen.\",\n",

I also have OCD, which causes me to obsess about sexual encounters and assault/abuse. this leads me to my current state. there were a few things during sex that this person did without asking that i wasnt crazy about. in one instance, i was blowing him and he pulled me up for a kiss. he then pushed a bit on my shoulders to indicate he wanted em to continue. i didnt like this because it reminded me of my ex who would forcefully push me down while i was actively struggling against him and i hadnt even indicated if i was interested in blowing him yet. i really think these situations were very different, especially with the new guy i was already blowing him and was happy to continue. the other things were he lightly and very playfully and gently slapped my arm/boobs. to me this is no different from a playful smack on the ass, not an indicator of a dangerous, violent partner. however, as i stated above my PTSD and OCD can make me hypervigilant and obsess. i know its fine to dislike things during sex, i’m not trying to convince myself that i loved that stuff, but i’m always afraid that something someone did is sexual abuse. i have obsessed about whether i was being sexually abused by every single sexual partner i’ve had since my initial abusive relationship and do not feel that way about those encounters now. i just really like this guy and i’ve never had someone care so much about my experience during sex. what do you guys think, does this seem like my hyper vigilance or am i giving this guy too much credit? any and all advice is appreciated!',\n",

With the rambling below, I\\'m wondering what peoples opinions are? \\n\\n\\\\--- ramble begin ---\\n\\nI remember during primary school being told my lack of focus could be ADHD in early 2000s, it was ruled out by my parents who said it\\'s just a thing for misbehaving kids and I can focus on video games so I just need to work harder.\\n\\nAll throughout school I barely passed anything, every grade being C or D. I had one exception of a random science module on radiation that I found really engaging and got the highest in the class, 29/30 score. \\n\\nGot to Alevel, failed everything in my first year, second year just drifted by not really hit by the consequences if I fail. This was until 3 days before a Business Studies deadline my teacher told me I was going to fail as there wasn\\'t enough time, so I worked 3 days 16hours straight each day to do all the coursework in one weekend, this plus my exams of other Es just scraped me into university. \\n\\nUniversity was a similar story, leave everything till the last minute and just do all the work in the last week or couple of days with a few all nighters. Every semester I\\'d try sit down and get my work done sooner, even try plan just doing 10 minutes per night but I\\'d end up spending hours staring at walls and counting the number of patterns or walking around in circles in my room. Alas, every semester work was completed in the last week, barely scraping a pass. \\n\\nWork started and similar things happened, I\\'d sit in the office, not do any work usually fiddle with a pen for a few hours in my head having arguments \"You\\'re just making this harder for yourself\" then having to rush to do a weeks worth of work in a day or two and burning myself out. I\\'ve been repeating that process for about 6 years now and being more \"Trusted\" at the company has allowed me to succeed even though I feel and know I\\'m not doing enough. Often now it\\'s trying to find excuses of why it takes me longer to do certain tasks.\\n\\nThroughout all of the above I\\'ve never questioned anything, multiple times now I had proved if I just wrestle with myself and force myself I can work, but I\\'d rather play games as it\\'s not a struggle. Everything else I try I find myself daydreaming or doing anything else within range, whether it\\'s another hobby or music, unless I can get myself 100% engaged by it it\\'s like there is no ability for output unless there is a deadline. \\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nInterested to hear peoples thoughts and thank you if you took the time to read this. I\\'ve heard of the NHS having at least an 18 month wait time so that is frustrating.',\n",

The general consensus was that it sounded a bit more like ADHD focus issues, so I came here. In my post, I mentioned trouble with focus, procrastination and restlessness. I also tend to zone out of conversations a lot, have always had extremely poor organisation, and terrible sleep patterns. I always used to multitask, like cooking while I read etc. because no one activity could really occupy me. I genuinely struggle to do anything I'm not interested in and honestly just ignore/avoid most things until they become a problem (I should mention there is a reasonable likelihood I may have autism, which I know shares some symptoms with ADHD). I have mentioned this to my therapist and also googled it and it appears that these things may be somewhat consistent with ADHD. However (I was slightly embarrassed to ask my therapist) I am worried I do not have ADHD because sometimes I can focus on things. For instance, as a child I was always restless and frustrated until I discovered reading. Ever since then, as long as I find the writing agreeable I can sometimes get so absorbed in reading I forget to eat/sleep/ move. Even that would fail sometimes, but the internet is my #1 failsafe because it just shuts down my brain. I tend to open a lot of tabs and flit from one to the other sporadically, but it's one of the only things where it doesn't feel like my brain is racing under pressure, and I am absolutely concentrated. Basically, sorry for the long rant and the maybe stupid question, but are these behaviours consistent with ADHD? I'm really very desperate to know so I can begin trying to get my brain 'in order.' Thanks.\",\n",

The little girl and her mom? I can’t watch a clip of that scene with a dry eye. \\n\\nWhat really got me was Violet and the main theme of the show. \\n\\nWhat is love? \\n\\nThat’s what hit me. \\n\\nIt’s the journey she takes to understand and resonate with other people and human emotions that makes me hug my stuffed panda and just cry my eyes out. \\n\\nLook, I have Asberger’s. It’s taken me a loooooooong time to accept that. I didn’t even fully understand what it meant until this year and i’ve had the diagnosis since I was about 10? (I’m 22) (edit: I spent my whole life wondering if I was a sociopath or something because I just can not understand people or how they interacted or anything but nope just aspbergers and without proper explanation as to what that meant.) \\n\\nI have zero social skills. I can carry on a conversation well enough but I do not understand social cues and  people as a whole. \\n\\nThe question I have asked my whole life is the same question Violet asks. What does it mean to be part of a society? What is my purpose? What does it mean to love other people and to feel loved in return? And even though this is a fantasy animated story, it hit me. Hard. \\n\\nI don’t understand these things. And I want to so badly.',\n",

Sometimes I guess right, but sometimes I just get more and more lost that it frustrates me to a great extent. \\n\\nI don’t think I’m retarded. I’m able to understand and solve rather complex logical problems, but not some soap opera shows with shitty plot. I suspect that it has something to do with my ADHD, but I’m not certain. I’ve ever heard of anyone else having the same issues as me. \\n\\nI was diagnosed four years ago but I think I’ve had it for the entirety for my life. I took Concerta for a few months but eventually stopped, because it only makes my tics worse. (I also have light Tourette’s.) And I haven’t been on any meds since.\\n\\nDoes anyone else also have this problem?  Is there a way I can actually fix it? Is it worth to go consult a psychiatrist?

I have found that when I have to multi-task, I fall apart. For example. I used to work drive-thru at Panda Express. I had to take orders, cash out people at the window, and get the food for the person who was ordering all within the same couple of minutes. I was absolutely horrible at it. For one, I can’t listen to someone speak while trying to do something unrelated at the same time. I would also get distracted by outside sounds or if a coworker was trying to work around me. Sometimes it was so bad that I would be so confused about what I needed to be doing and I had to stand there for a minute to gather myself and remember what needed to be done. I always needed help doing drive thru, and I was the only one who didn’t improve at it over time. In school, I would ask to do my classwork in the hallway if people inside the class were talking, because I couldn’t take in what I was reading/doing when sounds were distracting me. In general, I can’t process information if I have to do that alongside some other task. I have so many examples of my absolute inability to multitask. It’s made work and school quite frustrating and I don’t understand where the whole “adhd people can multitask well” stereotype. So what do they mean when they say that?

And the worst part is when these thoughts come in I panic I get scared like WHAT IF.... and then right there my stomach gets messed up And I have to go drop a duece and then I feel much better, has anyone ever felt the same?

Maybe it was something else. I also got some good news today. Despite my young age and COVID, a company decided to hire me. I can't believe it actually happened. I was certain young people like me finally became unhireable thanks to Covid. I just hope I don't accidentally screw it up. Who knows how long it'll take to find another company crazy enough to give young people a chance.\\n\\nAlso, I purchased some St John's Wart. Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to use it yet, because I need the cold meds to leave my system first. Otherwise, I'll get a serious, medical condition. (A condition the pharmacist failed to mention when I bought St John's Wart and cold meds at the same time.) However, with this new job, I may not need the wart anymore. Maybe I should take it just in case. I don't know.\\n\\nORIGINAL DEPRESSING POST:\\nI've always been depressed. This is mostly due to companies not wanting to hire young people like me. It's made it near impossible to get a job. Then Covid just made things worse. I've actually tried suicide once and failed. However, I've been able to manage my depression ever since.\\n\\nUnfortunately, my depression just came back en force. It feels like it's shutting me down. I feel hollow and cold. I don't feel like doing anything. I just want to lay down all day. I'm also not reacting to anything. Like, I'll watch something, my brain records it, and that's it. I almost feel brain dead. I've also lost a lot of my appetite. Today, I ate just one muffin, and I'm honestly not 100% sure why I ate it.\\n\\nThe worst part is most of my thoughts are about my knife being covered with my blood. I actually see it sometimes in my mind, and I kinda like it. I think about running the knife along my throat and feeling my hot blood flow over my cold body like a warm shower. Then, I think I should go for the wrist to avoid gurgling on my blood.\\n\\nI don't know how I managed to type all of this, or even why I'm doing it. I guess part of me is still functioning somewhere. However, I'm not sure how long I can hold out like this, especially without a source of income. I fear my odd, knife fantasy will very soon become reality.\\n\\nAlso, I got a cold a few days ago. Hopefully I'll feel better when it's gone, but I really don't know. It's definitely not helping.\",\n",

To be fair, I\\'m screwed. Here\\'s why:\\n\\n1. I have had no close friends for 2 years. This includes a period of \\\\~7 months prior to my state\\'s lock-down (NY, March 2020) due to the pandemic. I only speak with non-family members if I am approached or am required to.\\n2. Every week is the same. I have severe sleep deprivation, and tend to get no more than 6 hours of sleep most nights (with the exception of Friday and Saturday nights). Each weekday, it\\'s the same thing. It\\'s very, very monotonous.\\n3. I\\'m incredibly socially anxious. I\\'m unable to take compliments, and always assume people are not saying what they really think about me.\\n4. I\\'m very, very insecure about how I look and what I say. I\\'ve always told myself I\\'d never stand a chance with any girl due to my social awkwardness and mental health issues. Furthermore, I ask myself \"Why do you like \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_? It\\'s because you find her attractive, isn\\'t it? What if she didn\\'t look like that?\", which makes me feel like I\\'m stuck with being too shallow. Then, my insecurities start getting to me, and it really screws me up.\\n5. I did something I\\'m not entirely sure I should have done. This summer, I developed feelings for a girl, and eventually told her one day before the last time I\\'d see her in person. Even though we hugged after that (that hug meant a ton to me) and remained in touch until \\\\~2 months ago when we both became consumed by our daily obligations, I\\'m still stuck wondering why. Why\\'d I tell her? Why\\'d she hug me, and why was she willing to talk with me for those two phone calls? This is the point where I tell myself that she was probably only being polite, and didn\\'t want to possibly piss me off. But to be honest, I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever know the answer to these \"why\" questions. Basically, these insecurities that I was able to keep under wraps began to come back in full force following the end of the trip and contact with her. This is why I\\'m not sure I should have told her what I did, because it may be tied into all the insecurities that are making me feel particularly bad during depressive episodes.\\n6. Right now, I don\\'t know what I should do to make my life a bit more bearable. My depression bars me completely from taking action, whether it be \"just work out bro\" or seeing a therapist. Fleeting moments of happiness end up getting followed by periods of feeling like shit. I\\'m usually too afraid to tell people about this type of stuff, because it gets passed off as being \"cringe\". I don\\'t know what to do now. Where do I go? What should I do?\\n7. Finally, I\\'m scared of being forgotten. If I were to die right now, the only people who would be negatively affected would be my family and a few of my teachers. That girl wouldn\\'t be affected, because she wouldn\\'t know. There was a boy who I knew a few years back. He attempted suicide once, and then I briefly saw him in school for one more day. He disappeared, and I didn\\'t care. I doubt that those who knew him then remember him now. He could be dead, and I/we could say \"that\\'s sad\", and not actually acknowledge his death seriously. What\\'s to stop me from being forgotten by those I can\\'t forget?\\n\\nNote: I may be writing this during a depressive episode, but it\\'s only during these periods that I get an urge to talk about these issues I have. I\\'m sorry for writing this, S.F, even though you\\'ll never see this anyways. I hope you\\'re doing well, better than I am. (If this post is counted as creative writing for some reason, I\\'ll do something about it)',\n",

He can talk your ear off for hours about them but if you try to have a ‘serious’ or ‘not fun’ conversation he shuts down or just gets a blank look in his eyes.\\nI’ve been taking medication and therapy for over twenty years and have things ‘under control’ (within reason) but because he’s a substitute teacher he isn’t getting paid til the first week of October.

Also, my mood swings & lack of consistency, depression & anxiety that I’ve suffered from since I was in 7th grade, fidgeting, lack of organization, my reclusiveness and irritability, etc. I feel like I could go on and on and on about all the ways I’ve been so different than a lot of my peers as I was growing up, but it just makes me cry because I’m so confused. \\n\\nI think I’m looking for reassurance that everything will alright, no matter what happens tomorrow. I understand that ADHD can’t be diagnosed in one session, so what will we even go over during the first appointment?',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'Bear with me, because this is a very long story. I just feel that the details behind the situation are important.\\n\\nDuring my spring semester of junior year in college (currently about to enter my senior year), I slept alone in my campus suite many times because two of my roommates were studying abroad, and my other roommate would sleep at her boyfriend\\'s a lot (there\\'s 4 of us total). I never had any major issues with sleeping alone in the past, but starting in around February/March, I would hear extremely disturbing noises that sounded like it was coming from one of the other apartment units near me. When I say extremely disturbing noises, it was pretty much the epitome of a girl getting raped by her boyfriend (the noises were so detailed that I could even hear the conversations and name of the boy, and it just sounded like it was a relationship).\\n\\nThe first night it happened, at around 3am, I tried to ignore it because I couldn\\'t tell if I was actually hearing what I was hearing (I was also really high and sometimes my hearing is altered when I\\'m high), but when I heard the loudest coherent scream, I immediately jumped out of my bed and tried to see where it was coming from. I roamed all the hallways on my floor and the one below me (I\\'m the top floor). Literally no sound from anywhere.\\n\\nThe noises were pretty consistent, I got many of my building\\'s RA\\'s involved, and it was just a really black and white situation where they couldn\\'t do much about it. The sketchy part was that when I described the situation to the RA\\'s, they all gave similar reactions, the \"Oh, I think I know what you\\'re talking about\" type of reaction. Because of confidentiality reasons I guess, they really couldn\\'t do or say much to me, other than that \"they were there for me if I needed to talk about it.\" It was frustrating, but I kind of just let it go for a bit and continued hearing the noises.\\n\\nI started to think I was maybe crazy or even schizophrenic, I was getting absolutely no clarity or solution to what was happening. It sucked because there really wasn\\'t anything I could do. The worst nights where when I thought this girl was in real danger (her screaming things like \"somebody help\" or \"please stop\" at the top her lungs). I would up crying traumatized by the noises and my helplessness. Every time I called the RA\\'s, nothing would be resolved, I didn\\'t even know if they checked the halls to try to navigate the noise.\\n\\nSo, a lot of this continues, where I would try to ignore it certain nights (this wasn\\'t something that would occur every single night, but at least a couple of few times a week), hear too gruesome things some nights that resulted in me calling the RA\\'s, and then nothing really getting done. I lost so much sleep that semester.\\n\\nThroughout all this, I mentioned it to my roommate and asked if she could stay with me a few nights instead of her boyfriend. She doesn\\'t have the best hearing, but when there were extremely bad and loud screams, she would hear it as well. She even cried the first time she heard it because it was disturbing and distinct. We had absolutely no idea where it was coming from.\\n\\nThis experience is what traumatized me the most: when I was alone in the apartment one Thursday night, many students were going out, and typically they\\'d come home around 2-3 am ish. During this time, I hear some girls in a suite near me, and I have never heard the loudest cries for help in my life, along with a guy\\'s voice yelling \"shut the fuck up\" and loud and consistent banging. The sound was so loud and clear that I was almost sure it was next door. I broke down and thought I was going to die or something (sounds dramatic, but damn it was fucking scary), but my resident director, who lives across from me, knocked on a door and I could hear her yelling to open the door, and then another man\\'s voice. I thought the situation was gonna be taken cared of, but an hour passed and I STILL heard screaming. I called my campus police. I have never called my campus police or 911 before, but I actually thought my life was in danger. It was a very scary moment.\\n\\nThe police show up, and they get some info from, I tell them how I\\'ve been hearing concerning noises the past few months, but it escalated extremely tonight. I also told them I heard my RD get involved, but the noises continued for a bit and stopped again. They tell me to get some rest and that I would get an update the following morning. I heard them knock on my RD\\'s door, and they went inside so I couldn\\'t hear what was discussed, but they literally didn\\'t even knock on any door around me. They did, however, go immediately downstairs to the suite below me, and I hear them knocking for what felt like hours, banging on the door, screaming at the boys\\' suite to open the door. It was SO loud and clear, I also heard a girl scream, \"just open the fucking door.\" I didn\\'t know if campus police didn\\'t have a right to go into the suite or whatever, but the whole situation was just fucked.\\n\\nI didn\\'t sleep that night, couldn\\'t study for my Accounting exam, and couldn\\'t even make it to my class because of how sleep deprived I was. It was really taking a toll on my daily life, hearing the slightest banging noises in any environment made me so jumpy too. I never got an update on the situation from the campus police, so I call them myself in the afternoon, and they literally said that THE NOISE COMPLAINT WAS FROM A TV. Wtf?? None of it made sense.\\n\\nThen, one night AGAIN,  (I was probably seen as the crazy resident of my building by my RA\\'s), intense noises occur, and I call the RA on duty. He comes upstairs and stays for a bit, and hears some of the noises. He literally looks at me, points up the ceiling, and goes, \"these are coming from upstairs...you live on the top floor...\". I\\'m lost, and he goes \"I don\\'t wanna freak you out or anything but...you have been reporting these noises a lot at 3am. 3am is witching hour...you have, like, a LOT of mirrors in your suite...those are portals for spirits...the full moon was last week, when you called the police...\" So, as he\\'s saying all this I\\'m like what the fuck. I\\'m not a firm believer of ghosts, but everything he was saying was freaking me the fuck out. He suggests I buy some incense and holy water, bless my room, and this guy literally asks if I want a hug and leaves. (that part was kinda funny tho lmao). So I live the next few weeks of school believing I was truly being haunted by a bunch of ghosts. This all happens close to the end of the semester, so I was moving out soon.\\n\\nThis entire experience was extremely traumatizing for me, especially that one night where I called the police. Still don\\'t know whether it was spirits or real people, but I have an irrational fear every single night that my place will be invaded or that I will be choked by a ghost or something. I rarely slept alone after moving out though, because I spent a lot of time staying at my boyfriend\\'s place. But the times I did sleep alone, I would always hear the SAME noises, or I just could not fall asleep because my heart would be racing so much from fear that I wasn\\'t safe or something. When I would sleep with my boyfriend, I would still get jumpy from any slight noise, but having his presence obviously made things much better.\\n\\nI interned in another city this summer and got a place alone (yeah sounds really stupid now that I think about it, but I don\\'t think I understood how bad it was to actually sleep alone after the experience at school), and every time I would sleep alone, I would be scared out of my mind and couldn\\'t fall asleep for hours. I got lucky because my boyfriend moved to the same city full time to start his job (he\\'s a year older), so we were able to spend a lot of nights together throughout the summer.\\n\\nNow that I\\'m back home, I have not been able to sleep alone in my room because I am the only one sleeping on my floor (parent\\'s master bedroom is on the third floor and my older brother has already moved out of our house). I\\'ve been going upstairs to my parents\\' room every single night to sleep with my mom since my dad is out of town on a business trip right now, and it\\'s so embarrassing. Thankfully, my mom is the sweetest and most caring woman on this planet, so she takes it all ready well and is understanding. She was actually the first person I called before calling the police the night of the incident. Last night, I went upstairs to sleep with my mom again, because I thought I heard footsteps near my bedroom (we live in a house, not an apartment btw), and was almost convinced we were having a home invasion. I had to call my mom to come downstairs so I could go up with her (damn, typing it all out actually makes it sound so much worse), and slept upstairs again. But the scary thing is, even when I had earplugs in last night, I started to hear the same girls\\' voice in my head. It sounded so real, I even got scared for a second that it WAS real, but obviously it wasn\\'t. That also wasn\\'t the first time it happened, where I think about the noises before sleeping, and I hear it again just by thinking about it.\\n\\nSo, given the past situation/incident and what\\'s been going on with me after it, does it sound like PTSD?? It\\'s taken a huge toll on my sleep when I\\'m alone. The only thing is that it hasn\\'t really taken a toll on my daily life after moving out, as this is only something I fear at night, alone. I guess my biggest fear is a combo of having my home invaded and coming across a spirit of some kind. Not really sure what to do, not really sure what I wanted to get out of this post, but glad I got to really write out in detail what i\\'ve been going through.\\n\\nTLDR; I consistently heard disturbing noises last semester at school and can\\'t sleep alone now because I have developed a fear of a home invasion and ghosts.',\n",

English is not even my first language, so, I am not sure why they think that. I do agree that my written text looks very formal sometimes and comes off in a very formal tone but I am just tired of people picking on irrelevant things, misunderstanding me and attacking me personally.\\n\\nI like certain subreddits because I like to be of some use to people if I have any insights. But I get downvoted way too often and I don\\'t even realise why, sometimes. Maybe it is common knowledge and it is just how things are on Reddit, but honestly, I don\\'t understand it. Not that I care about my karma or anything, I just feel a little hurt seeing that people think I am mean or rude or stupid.\\n\\nThis is just a vent and I am not asking for advice per se. I am just exhausted. No matter how hard I try by putting disclaimers, tone tags or even apologise in advance, I get misunderstood a lot. I once told someone I am neurodivergent and they said I am using it as an excuse to be an asshole. I am tired.',\n",

Looking back in retrospect, I had symptoms as early as 8 years old. \\nMy experience is common in some ways and more unusual in others. My most common symptom is obsessing over fake scenarios in my mind. I find pleasure in them to distract me from discomforting thoughts. I can obsess over one scenario or multiple ones at any point in time. The symptom that revealed my disorder was when I was tearing the callouses off of my feet with my nails and eating the dead skin. This is a ritualistic behavior. I do not obsessively clean a lot. It can be a symptom. However this is more uncommon for me to experience. I have an obsession for spatial organization. For example I organize books from longest length to shortest length. I have intrusive thoughts but they flash in my mind for a moment jerking my body. A curse word usually comes out impulsively. I do experience depression during emotionally stressful times. During good times, I experience sadness no more than the typical person. \\nMy biggest hardship is I zone out into my own thoughts while people are talking to me. It’s difficult to control and I come across closed off and cold. \\n\\nStereotypes are very common. Most people assume I’m a clean freak. I do upkeep but I am no more clean than the average put together person. Most people assume I “flip light switches” or have to do something a certain number of times to avoid bad luck. I do not do this. The most annoying one is people assume they might have OCD because they like to organize after I tell them about my diagnosis. OCD compulsions are different than spring cleaning organization. The typical image I hear about with OCD people is the person who washes their hands 20x a day, organizes constantly, cleans constantly, and does weird habits like flipping light switches. Ocd can be much scarier than people realize. For example, when I’m angry I can obsess over a scenario where I torture and kill the people who hurt me. Suicidal thoughts can happen when under duress. It’s a real disorder with the problems often outweighing the benefits.\\n\\nI have an actual diagnosis. People should not assume they have this disorder until they have seen a professional. I go to therapy and take medicine. It makes a world of a difference and most people would not ever notice I am on the OCD spectrum disorder. \\n\\nThis is my experience. I welcome anyone who wishes to tell me about their experiences.',\n",

Because they would kid, banter to me or joke about me being I’m into kids or would subtly keep inducing paedo related jokes. And with those I kind of freeze and I don’t know how to react. I somehow dismiss them and I catch myself reacting wrongly every time that happens. I hate the feeling of hiding. Any tips on how I should react when people do this? should i just play along with their jokes or what?

In march, my whole family got corona and my dad was in the hospital for over a month in intensive care. He was in a coma for 9 fucking days. That ‘friend’ who was talking shit, said she didn’t believe I had corona. Like, do you think my dad liked going into a coma? Do you think I like to fear for my dads life? Do you think I would actually lie about something so sensitive? She said she didn’t believe me because I wasn’t tested. My country didn’t have enough tests at the time so that’s why only the people in the hospitals were getting tested butI clearly had symptoms of corona. I didn’t like her before all this but now, it’s even worse. Ever since I went through my trauma, I have this built up anger inside of me. I’m not a violent person at all but if she was at school, I might’ve hit her right then and there. I wanna scream at her so badly and cry at the same time. I don’t know what to do when she comes back to school. I want to confront her but I think that would make it worse. Luckily, I have my therapist appointment tomorrow. Hopefully she doesn’t come to school tomorrow, for her own good lol. What a fucking bleep. I really have lost all hopes for this schoolyear.\\n\\nTL;DR: fuck my friends.',\n",

I've been on meds for ADHD since my 20's so around 20 years and in the past couple years my ability to paint has fallen away. I have a job that makes the medication necessary, but do I really have to decide between a job for money verse a passion that makes me feel alive? By far this is one of the strangest places I've been in as far as life realizations go. I noticed over the last 6 months that it seemed like my meds stopped working all together.  I started letting general housekeeping slide, sleep became a struggle, I couldn't get myself out of bed to workout. So, a few days ago I met with a doctor to discuss a possible change in my medication, decided to switch from Vyvanse 50mg to Focalin RX 30mg. The first few days on Focalin have not gone well, but I'm not sure if that's because I'm coming off of the Vyvanse or reacting to the Focalin. Yesterday, and seriously this is the scariest thing that has ever happened to me, I had to leave work early, because I was struggling to communicate verbally. Like talking. I could type, write, think (for the most part) clearly, but had to focus and really work to put the words together and out my mouth. Sent that feedback to my doctor who responded : we could up the dose of Focalin? Maybe that's a side effect from the Vyvanse?  Has anyone experienced that kind of side effect?\",\n",

She did message me a lot less yesterday but seeing how I didn\\'t expect her to text me during a family dinner I didn\\'t think anything of it.

I then moved across the country for a PhD program two years ago and COVID, personal life issues, and the high demands of a PhD program have really rocked me and I began to flounder.   \\n\\nEarly on I found a good psych who lets me try whatever I ask for. I asked to start with pregabalin for anxiety and then moved to clonazepam and landed on diazepam all on my request. I have been stable on the diazepam for anxiety for like a year and a half now.\\n\\nA year ago during the middle of all the COVID shit I decided to give ADHD meds another try. I requested Dexedrine and took 5-10mg twice a day for around 6 months. It worked well but the peakiness and crashes of IR were annoying and I was still getting more peripheral effects than I liked. \\n\\n6 months ago I asked to switch to Vyvanse and started out on 10mg a day and stayed there for 4 months moving to 20mg for the last two months. My psych wanted to start me at 30mg but I wanted to start as low as possible. I liked it better than Dexedrine but I still got way too many peripheral effects, increased anxiety, and tachycardia. I’m a fast metabolizer so I also get a bit of a crash after 5ish hours and take a 2.5 milligram IR booster at around the 6 hour mark.\\n\\nI love the focus and motivation enhancement I get but I don’t know how long I can stand the side effects for. The reviews on medication websites for desoxyn are insane and the reviews along with scientific studies I’ve found seem to support that desoxyn is smoother with less peripheral stimulation and better for anxiety than other amphs and phenidates.\\n\\nI’m scared shitless of asking my psych because of the stigma. I wrote out a long email to him explaining my side effects and then giving my justification for why I want to try desoxyn with multiple research studies attached. My wife is sketched I want to ask for this at all and says the email is too desperate, but I’ve heard that the people who have been prescribed Desoxyn came in prepared with research.\\n\\nWhat do y’all think would be the best course of action? Should I send the long ass email that takes up two pages on Microsoft word with like 7 different attachments and links to research studies? or should I just wait until my appointment in December and casually ask to try it? \\n\\nIf you are still here thanks for sticking with me.

I have lived a pretty good life up until last November when I had my first panic attack out of no where. It happened at my college where I was almost finished with my 1st semester of Junior year. I had started to freak out over some sharp pains in my chest, I took a seat and then I started hyperventilating and absolutely flipping out. It got so bad I got my friend to take me to a hospital. Anywayssss, ever since that day I’ve never been the same. I’ve had multiple attacks that had finally stopped back in January. However, even without the attacks, I’ve felt like crap pretty much every day since the first one. Too add onto the pain, in February, I read an article on a man with PTSD who had failed to receive help and ended up killing his family and himself. Now, I’m a genuinely good guy and a pretty solid Roman Catholic. However, ever since I read that I’ve had Harm OCD thoughts about hurting my family (mainly parents who I relied on for support for my anxiety). Now everyday since then I’ve been terrified of myself and these thoughts I have. I would never hurt anyone especially my family yet these thoughts are so disturbing. Every day is almost the same for me with an endless cycle of what if’s and intrusive thoughts that make me scared of myself and what I think I’ve become (if that makes sense) I just want to find relief and have no idea how to get there. I wish I could be who I was 7 months ago and not have these disturbing, stressful, tiring thoughts ever day. Will I ever be able to “recover” so to say? I hate living my life like this. Thank you guys, and sorry for how long this was lol',\n",

Not perfect by any means, but I was in college, I had a summer job, an amazing girlfriend and just generally enjoyed my life. Looking back it feels like pure bliss. But it was all a thin veil over my destructive addiction. I got to a point where I wasn’t careful anymore about if anyone found back, and my girlfriend found out one summer afternoon. The shock and pain and horror on her face is something that will stick with me forever. Somehow she didn’t break up with me right then, but she did urge me to get therapy help. Maybe therapy did help a little but I already think everything through a million times in my head and I’m not super into talking about all of it twice a week. But regardless my mental state began to rapidly decline. It’s funny how easily we can rationalize and lie to ourselves about our problems, but as soon as someone else knows that facade just comes crashing down. That was the first time I thought about suicide. I had plans, but no real intent to follow through, but for the first time in my life it felt enticing and that definitely scared me. Most days that summer I struggled to get out of bed for work, and generally stayed to myself as much as I could. But this fall when I got back to college I thought things would finally turn around, being so close to friends and on campus activities. But really the opposite happened and I got so overwhelmed that I essentially stopped eating (losing 12 pounds in 3 weeks), and stopped going to class and doing work. I gave up and hoped it would get better in the future with no end in sight. A week into doing nothing I started having suicidal thoughts again, but these were worse. I had a plan, and a somewhat solid intent to follow through, but the night I would have done it my girlfriend asked me what was wrong and she held me as I sobbed for more than an hour and she walked me in the pouring rain to the police station to make sure I got the help I need. I ended up getting admitted to inpatient psychiatric care for 3 weeks. The day before I was released my girlfriend broke up with me. Upon release I took an indefinite medical leave of absence from school. For Halloween I went as a psych ward patient, lol get it ha.  My life has been flipped upside down and honestly I wrote this because a friend of mine gave me the idea, but miss my old life. Maybe it was ignorance or naiveté that allowed for that, but at least I could say I enjoyed at least half of the days I lived. Now I’m not sure if I can say I enjoy one a week. Maybe a day here or there, but not consistently. I know this is super long, and if you’re still here, thank you. I am tired and I want everything to be over, but I also want to find a way through. This will probably be the first of a few posts. I’d like to think that my story can help people, but maybe it will just make them more sad like me, and for that I am sorry, but thank you for reading.',\n",

I would get obsessed with someone I saw on TV, a teacher, a doctor, etc. Sometimes I can feel the obsession coming on in advance, but haven\\'t found a way to prevent any of them from fully developing. These obsessions can go on for weeks, months, or even over a year. During the time I\\'m obsessed with a person, I can\\'t stop thinking about them. I think about what they might be doing at the moment and what they would think of what I\\'m doing. I dream about them at night. I idealize them and make them into perfect people in my mind, and have an unhealthy amount of admiration for them. I have obsessive thoughts about how I could impress them so that they will admire me as much as I admire them. Even when I try to distract myself from the thought of them, they\\'re always in the back of my mind. It\\'s exhausting and I hate it, but most significantly, these obsessions can make me feel really anxious and confused about my life or who I am. \\n\\nI recently had knee surgery last week. I have unfortunately found myself obsessed with the orthopedic surgeon who performed my surgery. He was really nice and struck me as very knowledgeable and trustworthy, and my mind immediately got hooked. Since the surgery, I can\\'t stop thinking about my surgeon and his great bedside manner. I keep looking up videos of orthopedic surgeries on YouTube and imagining what it would be like if I was an orthopedic surgeon like him. \\n\\nNot only do I not enjoy thinking about my surgeon 24/7, this is making me really anxious because now I am obsessively questioning my career choice. I\\'m 21 and I am graduating with my bachelor\\'s in electrical engineering next year. I like electrical engineering, but I really only picked it because I didn\\'t know what else I wanted to do. Now I keep thinking that I\\'m interested in going to medical school so I\\'ll have to stay longer to complete biology and chemistry prerequisites that weren\\'t required for electrical engineering, but I also know that I\\'m currently going through an obsession and this is clouding my judgment.\\n\\nI keep having internal arguments with myself about whether or not I truly want to be an orthopedic surgeon. Even though I\\'m obsessed, it really feels like a genuine interest, but of course this may just be my OCD trying to disguise itself. I guess I won\\'t know for sure until this obsession runs its course, but there\\'s no telling how long it will last. It\\'s also hard to go out and do anything to distract myself since I\\'m stuck in the house recovering from my surgery.\\n\\nI\\'m just so tired of this. My obsessions with people make me forget who I am or what I like. I feel like I don\\'t even know myself more than half the time. \\n\\nIt\\'s always: \\n\\n\"Do I really like this or am I just obsessed?\"\\n\\n\"Is this person really that great or am I just obsessed?\"\\n\\n\"Is this really what I want to do or is it just an obsession?\"\\n\\nI wish I never developed these obsessions in the first place. If that was the case, I don\\'t think I\\'d struggle so much with self-doubt and figuring out where my true interests lie. This is so distressing to me.\\n\\nHas anyone gone through anything similar? How can I properly deal with these obsessions and always be able to tell the difference between my obsessions and my true interests?\\n\\nSorry for the long post. If you\\'ve read this far, I appreciate it.',\n",

I am in my second to last semester in the program and this has been very upsetting to me. I have ADHD and I receive some accommodations like extra time on exams. I feel as though I have been shuffled through a very unfair and rapid process that resulted in my dismissal. To get the full context of the situation you have to understand this program has two main methods of assessment. We have traditional lectures and exams and simultaneously we also participate in a clinical day at the hospital once a week. My two warnings over the past year and a half have been in the clinical setting and about the same thing preparedness.\\n\\nMost recently during my clinical day, I was chosen to administer medication for my patient under the supervision of the instructor. Each week the instructor will choose two students to give meds because they must supervise us and cannot do that for all six students during a shift. So it comes my time to give the medication and I and my instructor go over the medications he asks me questions about each med and expects me to give the therapeutic use, side effects, special precautions, etc. I believe that I had good rationales for each med and the given side effects etc. Although as we are going over it I had some issues recalling some more in-depth details. My instructor asked me many extra questions although he did not indicate that he felt I was unsafe to proceed. So we then continued on to draw up and administer the meds safely with no issue. This all occurred by 8 am on the day in question.\\n\\nThe day went on with no indication or criticism from my instructor. It was not until many hours later at the end of the day 6 pm that my instructor pulled me to the side and informed me that he was giving me a clinical alert for a laundry list of reasons that were not deemed issues before. He said that he felt I wasn't really understanding the flow of the clinical environment, claimed I was copying previous nurse's documentation, he even mentioned I was a minute late one day because my car was not working and I had to bike there. I was blindsided, to say the least, because up until that point I had barely spoken with him one on one more than a few minutes. And none of these concerns were mentioned up until that day which is the fourth week of clinical.\\n\\nI went home pretty upset and looked over things to see If I was missing something. We have a clinical evaluation tool shared on google drive that is filled out weekly by the student and the instructor. To my surprise, my evaluation for the first four weeks of clinical stated that I was progressing as expected in all categories. And there were no critical comments made of me whatsoever. Since this is the second clinical warning I am receiving it triggers an ad hoc committee that reviews my student file and decides whether or not I can continue in the program. The clinical warning occurred on 10/8 and the ad hoc meeting was held on 10/14. I was given a chance to respond to the accusations made in writing prior to the ad-hoc meeting and then I met with them after they made their final decision.\\n\\nSo they decided to dismiss me. And what I found strange was the clinical evaluation tool I mentioned prior had been heavily edited by my instructor prior to the meeting. I went from progressing as expected each individual week until 10/8 to having issues from day one. My instructor went back and changed everything after the fact to create an evidence trail and the comments made are inaccurate. This action gives me pause as I feel I am just being shoved out of the program. Now keep in mind I do very well on the lecture exams and Have shown improvement in clinical. Also, I had requested accommodations in the clinical a number of times in the semesters prior, and I was told that is not something that is typically done in the clinical setting.\\n\\nI feel like I had been labeled by this instructor as aloof and disinterested when he barely interacted with me. I think since ADHD is often an invisible disability it can cause instructors/management to write you off as an employee/ or student that doesn't care. I feel as though I have been labeled a problem and pushed out. I can't say I have been given much support at all. Especially during the pandemic, this program has mostly been a self-taught program. I plan on appealing this decision internally. And I am thinking of pursuing it legally as a discrimination or possibly retaliation case. Do you feel I have any sort of argument?\",\n",

              " {'sequence': 'I think it’s kind of an extension of moral OCD which has been one of the most prevalent themes for me for a while now. I watched pornography a lot growing up and I feel as if to some degree it shaped my perception of women in an unhealthy way for a while. I don’t really watch it anymore, and I’ve since begun to recognise and challenge these ‘ways of seeing’ in an attempt to better myself.\\n\\n\\nNothing too extreme, but I mean this as in things like “seeing a woman’s body as inherently sexual”. I know there’s of course nothing wrong with being attracted to someone’s body, I guess you can’t help it, but I feel like for a while my view was automatically skewed in that direction sometimes, which I feel was unhealthy. I’ve noticed there’s still some part of me that immediately views it from a primarily attraction-based point of view whenever I see a girl who I may find attractive. As in like the primary thought is about whatever it is I find attractive about them as opposed to anything else. Of course, I realise this is bad and counter it whenever it happens, but still.\\n\\n\\nThe problem is that I still have a constant impulse towards sexual fantasy. This is where the moral OCD comes in, I think. Because, month after month, no matter how much I feel bad about it, I always end up giving in to imagining stuff like that. I know fantasy is a normal part of sexuality - however, the stuff I imagine is of course reflective of stuff I’ve watched in the past to some degree. Not entirely, because I find a lot of porn kind of creepy/gross in retrospect, but it’s definitely still that kind of thing.\\n\\n\\nThe problem there is that, if this harmful shitty prejudice I had (or maybe still have to some degree even if I know it’s wrong, I don’t know) was partially shaped by watching that kind of thing, surely imagining stuff that’s basically the same at a similar frequency would have the same effect? There’s the possibility that acknowledging these things and having the ability to therefore not let them influence my worldview is a thing, but I’m not entirely convinced. It’s frustrating in that aspect because I’m sure to some degree it’s OCD but it’s entirely plausible for there to be a measure of truth to it, and I don’t want to just go and move on with my life if I don’t ‘deserve’ to, if that makes any sense.\\n\\n\\nSo it leads to this constant cycle of me not being able to help but give in to thinking about it sometimes (still not entirely convinced it’s not just me being a prick who doesn’t want to try hard enough, but that itself could just be an expression of the OCD), doing it, and then inevitably feeling awful about it afterwards. Often stuff I was okay with at the time of thinking about it feels kind of creepy or weird or not to my taste afterward, which heightens this (again, nothing extreme at all or actually particularly weird, so probably just an OCD overreaction as well, but, just kind of saying that it happens). So if I am doing something bad I’d at least like to be sure about it! But there’s no real way to be, and I don’t want to give into OCD if that’s what it is.',\n",

Im super curious since my irl adhd friends started meds as youths and didn't have a similar experience.\",\n",

Just so much built up emotions and thoughts and just need to share some. \\n\\nBeing undiagnosed and in the process of going to see a psychiatrist while in college is so damn hard. I’m (20M) in a constant loop of self doubt and overthinking. I feel so burnt out, tired, lonely, frustrated and just want to give up. \\n\\nFor years of not knowing what is wrong with me and keeping things to myself have probably made my mental health and problems worst. I’m tired of not being able to focus on the smallest things and my school work, always forgetful, never can stick to anything and so much more. I have no best friends anymore, or good friends to talk to. I recently opened up to my parents and they are kind of supportive, but that’s nothing like a good friend. \\n\\nAbout of month ago I met someone online who I really connected with, and later found out they have adhd along with other mental health issues. FINALLY, someone that understands me and what I’m going through. But now I feel like it might not last. She already has a girl bsf and a couple close friends and we live kind of far. We aren’t looking for a relationship only to be friends and potentially best friends depending on how things go. And she seems to display the same interest in friendship as me but I feel like it might die off. \\n\\nI hate that I constantly get attached to people so quickly. They show some interest or things go well at the start and all my thoughts are fixated on them. Maybe its because I’m super lonely. I know I struggle a lot with anxiety, but maybe I’m depressed too. I hate not being able to open up to ppl. I just feel like they won’t care or I’ll share to much, or they won’t find me interesting, or they will lose interest eventually. I want to make new connections so bad but I’m to scared to try. I’m just tired of being hurt. \\n\\nIt doesn’t help that I’m behind this semester in all my classes either. I just can’t mentally or physically bring myself to do work anymore. I do college online and live at home with my parents too. No job, no car, no real friends, no hobbies, no passion. I feel so unaccomplished and worthless, seeing peers and family seemingly doing so well. Ive tried to do things to help me feel better like taking long breaks from social media, trying to exercise/eat better, taking breaks from things I like to focus but nothing seems to help. I haven’t watched any of my tv shows in months and haven’t played my PS4 for even longer. Recently got a PS5 but haven’t even played that either in an attempt to focus on school. All my attempts at trying to make my life better have failed or haven’t been consistent.\\n\\nSo many times I just want to f*cking cry and I can’t. I feel super sad, mad, tired, etc but can’t even muster up any tears. Have I masked my emotions for so long in fear of being hurt that I don’t even know how to express my emotions to myself anymore??? Even writing this I can’t cry even if it hurts me so much inside. I have so much more I could rant about but I’m just so tired I can’t even bring myself to remember or try to. Is a somewhat normal life to much to ask for???\\n\\nTL;DR: I hate my life right now. I just need some answers for all these struggles I am facing. I feel like neglecting my mental health for years has finally almost pushed me to my breaking point. Struggling in school while having no close friends, hobbies, or passion for anything has just made things worst. I just hope things can start turning around eventually. I can’t live like this anymore.',\n",

We are paid for these biweekly and sometimes monthly calls. So we are on company time.\\n\\nWhile browsing through the long list of participates and viewing who has their video feed turned on, I noticed a man making fast hand movements with only wearing underwear. Clearly I knew what he was doing. So I took a screenshot to show to HR as evidence. Many times throughout the few minutes, I saw the man's penis in full plain view.\\n\\nI don't know if he was masturbating to pictures of other video call participates or not. But after finally realizing his video was on, he turned it off and a minute later he left the call.\\n\\nI contacted HR and provided all the evidence I have and opted to take a week off since I am so close to losing my mind from this experience that only reminded me of my hell.\\n\\nI am taking unpaid time off and will be seeking psychiatric help in this time as I feel medication is once again needed so I can function at work like nothing happened once again.

I constantly can just feel my tendons even when im not weightlifting and i have the urge to make the tendons shift to see if itll ease any pain. I then start to pick and scrape at my acne out of nervousness and my face gets all bloody and my heart rate goes through the roof. Im going to an allergist next month but i dont know if that will resolve it? If this doesnt resolve it then i need a blood test and i passed out and threw up during my last one\\n\\nI have this vision of myself being a strong man and i keep trying and trying to work towards it but im getting sent back by this pain constantly. And then i obsess over not being masculine or man enough for a partner. And then i flip out because i want a male partner and society frowns upon that. Then i think about how my first kiss was with another guy and how nice it was and i accept this as my definitive reality. And then i think i really should have had my first time with sex by now and idk if i want it to be with a man or woman and just ahhh it goes on and on and on!!!',\n",

              " {'sequence': 'After losing a close family member recently I noticed that I drink a lot more than normal. Maybe not in quantity but definitely infrequency as I have drank at least 28 days out of the past 30 days. After a an embarrassing drunk night last weekend I decided that I shouldn\\'t drink the next day. That was the first day in a month without drinking. I noticed the gravitational pull when I was around alcohol or anything related to alcohol that day. Last night was also a night that I did not drink but it was due to my wife giving me a judgmental look in the wine aisle\\n\\nThis has been concerning for me as I\\'ve never experienced this. But during meditation I noticed that that same impulsive feeling is the same feeling I have when it comes to going out to eat, or just about other activity that I enjoy. It is just so strong and since I\\'m not using fear as a means of self control anymore, I don\\'t have a lot of reason to resist it.  Before his passing, I always had a story of how everything would go in my head. Most things I\\'d find a way to invoke panic and fear to keep me from doing things but I realized that thinking held me back from more things than I was trying to hide from. Now I feel like a science experiment observing myself without a \"leash\" \\n\\nAs far as drinking goes and how I felt the same way when I wanted to go out for lunch yesterday, I managed not to do either. The feelings I felt were just the impulses of wanting it. I\\'m not craving the taste I\\'m craving the resulting feelings from partaking. I love how much I don\\'t care when I\\'m drunk. I\\'m just carefree and the guy I am when drinking (personality, energy, fun, confident) is the guy I\\'m fantasizing about being when sober. Honestly after a year of therapy it\\'s still challenging to be that way sober consistently. The way that I\\'m using alcohol isn\\'t long term healthy and it\\'s concerning to feel such a strong feeling around alcohol but I don\\'t see myself in the same light as people I work with or family that have certified drinking problems. As much as my ADHD will make me impulsive, my ADHD also gives me things in phases. Just like anything in my life like hobbies or interests, sooner or later I\\'m just gonna wake up one day and not touch it again for months or years so I\\'m not really *worried* at this point',\n",
